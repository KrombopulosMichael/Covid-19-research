Despite normalized glycocalyx dimensions, the Microvascular Health Score was significantly worse in long-COVID (2.72 vs 3.87 in controls; p = 0.002), and capillary recruitment was blunted (29% vs 70%), indicating a fixed, poorly adaptable microvascular bed. These abnormalities did not improve over time across ~1.5 years and were linked to neurocognitive complaints (lower density; p = 0.049).",

Two doses of inactivated vaccine produced very weak or undetectable neutralisation of all four sub-lineages. Booster immunisation (either homologous or heterologous) restored measurable neutralising titres, but still showed around 7- to 23-fold lower titres against Omicron sub-lineages compared to wild-type virus (for example, GMT ~537 for WT vs ~42 for BA.2 in one cohort). In parallel, evaluation of ~20 different mAbs revealed that most lost substantial neutralising activity against the Omicron sub-lineages; only a few retained broad potency (e.g., LY-CoV1404). Importantly, BA.1.1, BA.2 and BA.3 exhibited equal or even greater resistance than BA.1, suggesting that immune escape continues to evolve within the Omicron family.",

			"Text": "🐁Mild respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice, even without neuroinvasion, triggers persistent white-matter–selective microglial activation, reduced hippocampal neurogenesis, oligodendrocyte loss, and myelin degradation well after viral clearance. Elevated levels of the chemokine CCL11 are found in cerebrospinal fluid/serum of infected mice, and systemic CCL11 treatment in naïve mice reproduces microglial reactivity and blunted neurogenesis. In human post-COVID cases with lingering cognitive (“brain fog”) symptoms, plasma CCL11 levels are higher than in those without such symptoms, and postmortem brain tissue shows increased microglial reactivity in white matter compared to controls. By comparing with mild influenza infection, the authors show that while some neural changes are shared, the persistence of white-matter microglial activation and oligodendroglial/myelin loss appears more sustained in the SARS-CoV-2 setting. These findings suggest mechanisms linking even mild COVID infection to enduring cognitive deficits via neuroinflammation, white-matter injury, and chemokine-mediated microglial dysregulation. However, limitations include small human sample sizes, correlative human findings, lack of stratification by age/variant/vaccination, and reliance on a specific mouse model that may not capture the full spectrum of human disease.",

All strains and variants tested (Wuhan, Gamma, Delta, Omicron/BA.1, and the ORF7ab‐deleted mutant) showed ability to infect (or at least presence of virus) in the olfactory bulbs. Viral titers and RNA loads in olfactory bulbs were above detection for all groups. Evidence supports the olfactory pathway (sensory neurons in nose → olfactory epithelium → olfactory bulb neurons) as a route for brain invasion. No strong evidence was found for infection spreading via blood vessels or widespread brain infection beyond olfactory bulbs in this model. Retrograde and anterograde movement along axons was observed in in vitro neuron-epithelial systems. The original Wuhan strain caused the most severe clinical signs (e.g. weight loss), followed by Gamma, then Delta, and Omicron/BA.1 caused the mildest signs. Wuhan strain: high rate of full anosmia (complete loss) in many animals. Gamma: fewer full anosmia, but many animals had impaired smell. Delta & Omicron/BA.1: no detectable olfactory deficits in the behavioral test used – they did not lose smell. Removing ORF7ab from the Wuhan strain reduced incidence of anosmia: only ~25% of animals with ORF7-deleted virus showed anosmia vs ~62.5% with wild-type Wuhan. However, deletion of ORF7ab did not reduce neuroinvasion: virus still reached olfactory bulbs, etc.",

They identified 381 people whose viral RNA levels remained at high titre for at least 30 days, and among those 54 had persistence of at least 60 days. They estimate that about 0.7-3.5% of infections persist ≥ 30 days, and about 0.1-0.5% persist ≥ 60 days. People with persistent infections were ~55% more likely to self-report Long COVID (i.e. post-acute COVID-19 symptoms) than people whose infections cleared more quickly, however, only 9% of people with persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection reported having Long COVID",

Our findings indicate that persistent SARS-CoV-2 shedding may occur in both competent or immunosuppressed individuals, at multiple clinical sites and in a minority of subjects is capable of in vitro replication.",

It found that patients with COVID-19 exhibit marked increases in autoantibody reactivities as compared to uninfected individuals, and show a high prevalence of autoantibodies against immunomodulatory proteins (including cytokines, chemokines, complement components and cell-surface proteins). It was established that these autoantibodies perturb immune function and impair virological control by inhibiting immunoreceptor signalling and by altering peripheral immune cell composition, and found that mouse surrogates of these autoantibodies increase disease severity in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Plasma levels of IL-1β, IL-1RA, and IL-8, among others, were also increased in patients who recovered from COVID-19. This altered immunophenotype was mirrored by a reduced ex vivo T cell response to both non-specific and specific stimulation, revealing a dysfunctional status of T cells, including a poor response to SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Altered levels of plasma soluble PD-L1, as well as of PD1 promoter methylation and PD1-targeting miR–15-5p, in CD8+ T cells were also observed, suggesting abnormal function of the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint axis. Notably, ex vivo blockade of PD-1 nearly normalized the aforementioned immunophenotype and restored T cell function, reverting the observed post–COVID-19 immune abnormalities; indeed, an increased T cell–mediated response to SARS-CoV-2 peptides was noted. Finally, in a neutralization assay, PD-1 blockade did not alter the ability of T cells to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus infection. Immune checkpoint blockade ameliorates post–COVID-19 immune abnormalities and stimulates an anti–SARS-CoV-2 immune response.",

In human serum, patients with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibited decreased OPG and increased RANKL/OPG ratio compared with healthy controls. In vitro, macrophages and osteoclasts infected by murine coronavirus (MHV-3) showed enhanced differentiation and TNF release, while osteoblasts were unaffected. In vivo in mice, lung infection with MHV-3 led to femoral trabecular bone loss, increased osteoclast numbers at 3 dpi followed by a decline at 5 dpi, viral RNA and apoptosis in the femur, elevated TNF and RANKL/OPG ratio locally, and microCT evidence of reduced bone volume and increased bone porosity. Crucially, mice lacking the TNF-receptor p55 did not show bone resorption when infected, implicating TNF signalling as essential for this effect. The study thus suggests that acute coronavirus infection may exert deleterious effects on skeletal health via TNF-dependent activation of osteoclasts, raising concerns about bone loss even in non-fatal infection scenarios.",

However, later in the infection, peak viral loads in nasal swabs were significantly higher than in saliva or throat swabs. Surprisingly, several participants reported zero symptoms on the day of their peak viral Floads, all of which were >106 copies/mL. Overall, we found only a weak relationship between viral load and symptoms. Importantly, individuals had infectious viral loads in 42% of timepoints at which no symptoms were reported ",

Despite this, the proportion of patients with positive test results for COVID-19 who were admitted to an ICU, received mechanical ventilation, received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and died were each significantly lower in waves 5 and 6 when compared with waves 1 through 4. Admission to the ICU and in-hospital all-cause death rates were significantly higher among those who were unvaccinated against COVID-19 when compared with those who were fully vaccinated (incidence rate ratio, 4.3 and 3.9, respectively) or fully vaccinated with an additional dose (incidence rate ratio, 12.2 and 15.1, respectively).",

Random effects were used to estimate the pooled odds ratios (OR) and its 95% CI of different long-term symptoms between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. Five studies involving a total of 1643 cases, including 597 cases of asymptomatic and 1043 cases of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in this meta-analysis. The PPs of long-term consequences after asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections were 17.13% (95%CI, 7.55–26.71%) for at least one symptom, 15.09% (95%CI, 5.46–24.73%) for loss of taste, 14.14% (95%CI, −1.32–29.61%) for loss of smell, and 9.33% (95%CI, 3.07–15.60) for fatigue. Compared with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, asymptomatic infection was associated with a significantly lower risk of developing COVID-19-related sequelae (p < 0.05), with 80% lower risk of developing at least one symptom (OR = 0.20, 95%CI, 0.09–0.45), 81% lower risk of fatigue (OR = 0.19, 95%CI, 0.08–0.49), 90% lower risk of loss of taste/smell (OR = 0.10, 95%CI, 0.02–0.58). These results suggested that there were long-term effects of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as loss of taste or smell, fatigue, cough and so on. However, the risk of developing long-term symptoms in asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected persons was significantly lower than those in symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection cases.",

The NKT-like cell subset was decreased in patients with lethal outcome of COVID-19, which implies an antiviral role of this cell subpopulation and emphasizes its prognostic value. Along with an increase in the expression levels of HLA-DR and PD-1, and elevated IL-6 serum concentration, an increase in the CD16+ cell proportion among CD56− T cells may be considered the factor associated with increased COVID-19-mediated mortality. Moreover, a decrease in the expression of the NKG2D and NKG2A NK cell receptors observed in T cells of COVID-19 patients can potentially serve as prognostic indicators of the disease severity. Along with the depletion and hyperactivation of T cells, an elevated granzyme B level and a tendency to an increased TCR-independent functional activity were observed in CD56+ cells of patients with COVID-19.",

Results indicated that CSF proteome changes after infection resolution corresponded with bronchial virus abundance during early infection and revealed substantial differences between the infected non-human primates and their age-matched uninfected controls, suggesting these differences could reflect altered secretion of CNS factors in response to SARS-CoV-2-induced neuropathology. Infected animals exhibited highly scattered data distributions compared to their corresponding controls indicating the heterogeneity of the CSF proteome change and the host response to the viral infection. Dysregulated CSF proteins were preferentially enriched in functional pathways associated with progressive neurodegenerative disorders, hemostasis, and innate immune responses that could influence neuroinflammatory responses following COVID-19. Mapping these dysregulated proteins to the Human Brain Protein Atlas found that they tended to be enriched in brain regions that exhibit more frequent injury following COVID-19. It, therefore, appears reasonable to speculate that such CSF protein changes could serve as signatures for neurologic injury, identify important regulatory pathways in this process, and potentially reveal therapeutic targets to prevent or attenuate the development of neurologic injuries following COVID-19.",

The addition of exogenous ceramide after the downregulation of ASM by pharmacological inhibition restores infection with SARS-CoV-2. Thus, ceramide on the cell surface is necessary for infection with SARS-CoV-2. The ASM/ceramide system may be important not only for virus entry into the cell but also for the release of cytokines such as IL-6. Antidepressants reduce the level of proinflammatory cytokines in preclinical studies and patients with major depressive disorder. Importantly, reduced IL-6 levels were also found in COVID-19 patients treated with the FIASMA hydroxyzine. The ASM/ceramide system can help to explain the typical risk factors for a lethal COVID-19 course since ceramide abundance is increased in advanced age, hypertension or obesity, and the increased rate of thromboembolic complications in the setting of COVID-19 can also be explained by the ASM/ceramide system.

The cumulative incidence of long COVID by day 300 was 6·3% (95% CI 4·2–8·2) in participants who received metformin and 10·4% (7·8–12·9) in those who received identical metformin placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0·59, 95% CI 0·39–0·89; p=0·012). The metformin beneficial effect was consistent across prespecified subgroups. When metformin was started within 3 days of symptom onset, the HR was 0·37 (95% CI 0·15–0·95).

An increasing acceleration of epigenetic aging in the sequential samples of healthy, non-severe and severe groups was found. The accelerated DNAm ages at initial phases were partly reversed at the later phases in some COVID-19 patients by using the five epigenetic clocks, while the reversible outcome of accelerated attrition of DNAm TL from initial to later phases was found only in one patient.

Proteomic signatures in these tissues implicate inflammatory, neutrophil/NET, IL-18, PI3K/AKT, and neurodegeneration-related pathways, suggesting chronic perturbation of the brain border environment. In mice, exogenous spike injection (in absence of full virus) induces neuroinflammation, increases markers of apoptosis (caspase-3) and APP, and worsens outcomes in stroke and TBI models. Vaccination reduces but does not fully prevent spike accumulation. The authors argue that persistent spike at brain border regions may underlie long-COVID neurological sequelae by sustaining low-grade inflammation and sensitizing the brain to additional insults.",

			"Text": "There is evidence that viral RNA may persist in certain tissues for a long time after COVID-19 infection (up to nearly two years in some cases). This is associated with ongoing immune activation (particularly T cells) in various body regions. T cell activation doesn’t only occur in people with Long COVID symptoms. Certain tissues (gut wall, spinal cord) show stronger association with symptoms. That suggests some, but not all, of the immune activation may contribute to symptom persistence. The study investigated long-term tissue-level immune activation and viral persistence in people after SARS-CoV-2 infection, including in those with Long COVID symptoms. It uses imaging and tissue biopsies to look for evidence that virus or immune activation might linger long after acute infection. 24 people who had had COVID-19, imaged at times ranging 27 to 910 days after acute infection. Some had Long COVID symptoms, some didn’t. PET imaging using a tracer called [^18F]F-AraG, which specifically marks activated T lymphocytes. That allows anatomical quantification of T cell activation in various tissues. For a subset of Long COVID participants, colorectal tissue biopsies (rectosigmoid) were examined for presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via in situ hybridization, and via immunohistochemistry. Blood plasma protein profiling showed that people with more Long COVID symptoms (>5) and higher tissue uptake had elevated markers of immune activation/inflammation. In biopsied colorectal (rectosigmoid) tissue from a subset of Long COVID participants, SARS-CoV-2 RNA (spike gene) was detected in lamina propria cells. The period after infection ranged from ~158 to ~676 days. In spinal cord and gut wall in particular, the degree of T cell activation was associated with presence of Long COVID symptoms. Elevated activation in a variety of tissues, even long after infection (up to ~2.5 years). T cell activation (measured by PET tracer uptake) was higher in the post-acute COVID group compared to controls in many anatomical sites: brainstem, spinal cord, gut wall, bone marrow, hilar lymphoid tissue, cardiopulmonary tissue, nasopharyngeal tissue, etc.",

Cognitive test used: spatial working memory from the CANTAB battery. Analyses: Volumetric_Δ: change in cortical/subcortical volumes pre→post COVID vs controls. Eigenvector Centrality_Δ (ECΔ): change in centrality in various brain regions (a measure from functional connectivity / network analysis) pre→post COVID vs controls. Decline in volume of the left hippocampus in COVID-positive group vs controls (Volumetric_Δ significantly different; p ≈ 0.041). In particular, reduced EC_Δ in the left amygdala was observed in the COVID+ group. COVID+ participants showed reduced performance in spatial working memory compared to controls post-infection. Importantly, the reduction in connectivity (EC_Δ) in the left amygdala mediated the relationship between having had COVID-19 and poorer spatial working memory. These effects were observed even though infections were mild and in young people; suggesting that even mild COVID-19 may lead to lasting structural/functional brain changes and modest cognitive changes.",

Molecular modeling (docking + molecular dynamics simulations) suggested that the Spike RBD of SARS-CoV-2 can bind to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of CD4, in a region that overlaps the ACE2 binding domain. The interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation: Spike protein and CD4 physically bind in assays. Infection of CD4⁺ T cells altered their function: some effects on gene expression (immune response genes) and possibly exhaustion or changes that could affect helper T cell function. (E.g. suppression of cytokine production, modulation of immune activation.). Proportion of CD4⁺ T cells infected in vivo appears small; it’s not yet clear how much direct infection contributes vs other causes of T cell depletion or dysfunction.",

In brain tissue (from the two autopsy cases), IDO2 is also expressed long after infection. Long COVID PBMCs show reduced mitochondrial function (lower respiration / spare capacity). Lower intracellular amino acids, and lower levels of metabolites of the Krebs (TCA) cycle. Increased signs of autophagy, and signs of apoptosis in some cases. The degradation products of tryptophan (kynurenine metabolites) are altered: specific patterns correlate with severity/symptomology. The enzyme IDO2 seems to be a driver of these changes. Ex vivo, using an AHR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor) antagonist reduces IDO2 expression and reduces autophagy in PBMCs. Brain tissue sample is very limited (only two Long COVID autopsy cases), so generalizability for brain findings is uncertain.",

The lymph node (LN) aspirates showed robust spike-specific GC activity even weeks after vaccination. This supports durable maturation of the antibody response. Antibodies elicited by vaccination do neutralize multiple variants, but (unsurprisingly) neutralization is lower for more antigenically divergent variants. Prior infection + vaccination (“hybrid” immunity) generally gives broader and stronger neutralization compared to vaccination alone. Evidence of “immune imprinting” (sometimes called “original antigenic sin” in other viral systems) was observed.",

The hazard ratio for reinfection was very high in that early window. Those who got reinfected had lower neutralizing antibody titres (for both ancestral strain and Omicron BA.1), and lower anti-RBD IgG and IgA antibodies after their initial Omicron infection, compared to those who did not get reinfected. Time since last vaccine dose, age, sex, frailty, and number of facility outbreaks were not significantly associated with reinfection risk in the group already with prior Omicron infection. Some different vaccine brand combinations (mRNA-1273 vs BNT162b2) showed small signals of different risk, but overall hybrid immunity in this older cohort was quite heterogeneous. The study investigated 750 older adults (residents of long-term care and retirement homes) who were highly vaccinated (four doses of monovalent mRNA vaccine) to see how well hybrid immunity (vaccine + infection) protects against reinfection, particularly with Omicron subvariants. In a subset of 318 of these residents, immunologic assays were done (antibody levels, neutralization, T cell memory) in the three months before that observation period.",

Using microscopy, immunofluorescence, and RNA in situ hybridization, they found SARS-CoV-2 proteins (spike and nucleocapsid) in the epithelial layers and lamina propria of the papillae. In several cases, negative-strand RNA was also detected, indicating active viral replication in taste tissue up to 40 weeks after infection. The infected papillae showed disrupted taste bud architecture, with missing or misshapen buds and a loss of neurite fibers that normally connect to sensory nerves. Patients with partial recovery over time displayed regrowth of nerve fibers and restoration of papilla structure, while viral protein clearance appeared patchy across the tongue. These findings provide strong evidence that long-term taste dysfunction in COVID-19 is linked to local viral persistence and structural damage rather than solely systemic inflammation. The results underscore that some Long COVID symptoms may stem from direct viral reservoirs in sensory tissues, highlighting the importance of exploring antiviral and regenerative strategies for treatment.",

Certain factors (ICU stay, smell/taste loss, cardiovascular problems) increased odds of recovery, while muscle pain, attention impairment, and breathing or heart rate problems reduced it.

The amplified epigenetic “memory” gets transmitted to downstream innate immune cells (e.g., monocytes), which display hyper-responsive inflammatory behavior even months later. early high levels of IL-6 during infection contribute to establishing this epigenetic memory, and blocking IL-6 signaling in a mouse model mitigates some of the persistent immune reprogramming.

The effect is demonstrated in multiple cell types, lung organoids, and in mouse models.

Re-examining key datasets (including Loeb 2022) and the Cochrane review under this framework, the authors argue that N95s likely provide substantially greater protection than surgical masks, and that accounting for source control and two-way masking magnifies benefits.

However, the immune system retains robust memory via RBD-specific memory B cells, which do not diminish in number and in fact evolve: they acquire more somatic hypermutation and greater neutralizing breadth and potency, even against some RBD mutations. This suggests that although antibody levels fall, the quality of the memory response improves over time. Additionally, antigen persistence in the gut appears to be present in 7 out of 14 individuals up to ~4 months post-infection. Such persistent antigen may help sustain germinal centre activity, driving the ongoing evolution of memory B cells.",

They also collected self-report measures of fatigue, depression, sleep quality. They found that PCC patients had substantially slowed reaction times even on the simple task: large delays vs both control groups, consistent across both clinic sites. In SRT, many PCC patients fell multiple standard deviations behind controls. On NVT (more demanding), PCC patients showed slower responses (~150–200 ms slower than both No-COVID and No-PCC controls) and less vigilance. The cognitive slowing was not strongly associated with depression or sleep disturbance (though those were elevated), suggesting that slowing is not entirely explained by mood or sleep problems.",

A group of 98 male participants had brain MRIs and neuropsychiatric assessments before Omicron wave (“pre-Omicron baseline”), and 61 of them were re-evaluated in the acute/post-Omicron period (mean ~ a few weeks after infection). Some (~17) also had 3-month follow-ups. These neuroanatomical changes occur even though most participants had mild infection and were relatively young (mean age ~43), and follow-up at ~3 months indicates many systemic symptoms improve, but the brain structural differences persist. Clinically, these imaging changes are associated with detectable neuropsychiatric effects: heightened anxiety correlates with cortical thinning in the precuneus; cognitive tests like word fluency link with hippocampal volume. Left precuneus thickness: decreased by about 0.14 mm post-infection compared with pre-Omicron baseline. Right lateral occipital thickness: decreased by ~0.12 mm. Right hippocampus volume ratio (to total intracranial volume): decreased by ~0.02%.

The study shows that spike protein variants that promote more cell-cell fusion (i.e. more fusogenic S proteins) are better able to withstand interferon treatment in vitro, in airway organ cultures, and in hACE2 transgenic mice. At the same time, higher fusogenicity correlates with reduced neutralization by antibody reagents, meaning that immune pressure favors variants that can fuse infected cells into syncytia. Despite the replication cost of forming syncytia under low immune pressure, the authors suggest that the immune environment in the host selects for fusogenic spike variants. These findings explain why variants with more cell-cell fusion capacity (such as certain Delta or Omicron derivatives) are being selected, and highlight syncytia formation as a mechanism of immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2.",

Neurocognitive functioning was inversely correlated with LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) blood levels, a potential biomarker of disease severity. Common risk factors for having cognitive problems included older age, male sex, less education, greater disease severity during the acute phase, and specific symptoms like anosmia and dyspnea. Those with impaired cognition also tended to have higher levels of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and worse general functioning. In this study, from 1,344 screened, only 736 entered the screening phase, and 402 completed the baseline in-depth assessment. Those who stayed were older, more often male, less educated, had more severe COVID-19, and worse MoCA scores than those who dropped out.",

In acute disease, markers of platelet activation and coagulation were elevated, and NETosis induction correlated with these and with how severe/long the disease was. Treatment (dexamethasone) and recovery reduce this induction. In long COVID, even after convalescence, patients maintain a heightened NETosis induction capacity despite having similar levels of NET fragments to other recovered patients.",

However, a significant fraction continue to have symptoms: about 7.5% report symptoms lasting 12 weeks or more (Long COVID), and ≈5.2% still have symptoms at 52 weeks or beyond. Key risk factors for longer symptom persistence include female sex, having pre-existing health conditions, more severe initial illness, earlier infection (wild-type variant), and higher socio-economic deprivation. Conversely, people infected during the Omicron-dominant period were much less likely to have persistent symptoms. Those with long-lasting symptoms report substantially worse quality of life, mental health, and more frequent, burdensome symptoms (such as fatigue, difficulty thinking or concentrating, breathlessness, loss of smell or taste) compared to both recovered COVID cases and people never infected.",

CD4+ T helper cells are similarly depleted in both, but COVID-19 shows much more severe depletion of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and NK cells. B cell counts are somewhat reduced in both, though not significantly different across the diseases. These distinct patterns suggest that while both viruses lead to lymphopenia, the immune dysregulation in COVID-19 involves more profound suppression of CD8+ T cells and innate immune NK cells, which may contribute to the acute disease severity.",

Neurodevelopmental evaluations at multiple time points revealed that about 20% of exposed infants had neurodevelopmental delays by 12 months, compared to under 6% in controls, giving a relative risk of about 3.44. These delays were particularly evident in fine motor and personal-social domains. The pattern of impairment varied over time in exposed infants: high at 4 months, low at 6 months, rising again at 12 months. 137 children were followed for one year: 69 with prenatal exposure (“exposed group”, EG) and 68 unexposed (“control group”, CG). Neurodevelopment was assessed repeatedly (at 1,2,3,4,5,6,9,12 months) using the Guide for Monitoring Child Development in the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness context. For the exposed group, additional assessments at 4, 6, and 12 months used the Ages & Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-3). Demographics between groups were broadly similar.",

Examination of the placentas showed SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins, vascular malperfusion, elevated inflammatory and oxidative stress markers, and reduced hCG. In one fatal case, SARS-CoV-2 proteins were also found in the infant’s brain at autopsy, suggesting possible direct brain infection. The study suggests that in utero exposure to SARS-CoV-2 can lead to brain injury via placental inflammation and dysfunction, even in absence of vertical transmission detectable at birth, and that current fetal monitoring may miss these harms.",

This suggests that both innate and adaptive immune dysregulation are involved in the brain injury that occurs in COVID-19. The study identifies specific inflammatory mediators (e.g. IL-6, IL-12p40, HGF, CCL2, IL-1RA) that correlate with the severity of neurological involvement. Autoantibodies against neuronal/glial proteins are more frequent among those with neurological symptoms. Beyond the acute phase, even after systemic inflammation and autoantibody levels decline, markers of brain injury (notably NfL and GFAP) remain elevated in people who had neurological complications. This indicates that some forms of brain injury in COVID-19 may be long-lasting or slow to resolve, despite resolution of overt inflammation.",

After an exercise challenge, these impairments worsen: metabolic disturbances intensify, muscle damage increases, immune cell infiltration occurs, and amyloid‐containing deposits accumulate in muscle tissue. Importantly, the study did not find elevated levels of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in skeletal muscle of Long COVID patients relative to controls, before or after PEM induction, implying that viral persistence (at least of that protein in muscle) is not the main driver of these muscle deficits.",

In acute infection, virus‐specific T cells are crucial: CD8⁺ T cells kill infected microglia and astrocytes, while interferon-γ is required to suppress virus in oligodendrocytes. To avoid excessive damage in CNS tissue, after the acute phase, cytolytic T cell functions are downregulated and virus‐specific antibody responses in the CNS increase.

Mechanistically, reinfection skewed immunity: dendritic cells matured, CD8 T cells increased, the CD4/CD8 ratio decreased, and IL-6/IL-17 surged. RSV F protein persisted in glomeruli up to day 56, implying direct viral involvement in addition to immune-mediated injury.

Specifically, CD4+ T cell populations in LC are more likely to express markers that allow them to home to inflamed tissues, and SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells show exhaustion signatures. There is also a miscoordination between T-cell and B-cell (antibody) responses in LC, suggesting that though both adaptive arms are active, they are not working in a well-orchestrated way. These immune irregularities may underlie the persistent symptoms seen in LC — such as fatigue, cognitive issues, sleep disturbances — perhaps driven by ongoing antigen exposure or dysregulated immune signaling.",

Both groups report persistent symptoms of similar severity, indicating that immune response strength or detectability does not map straightforwardly onto symptom burden. These findings suggest that long COVID is not a single immunological state but may have (at least) two subtypes: one where the immune system has mounted a strong antiviral adaptive response but symptoms persist (potentially via immunopathology or chronic antigen exposure), and another where the antiviral response is weak, which might allow antigen persistence or inadequate clearance.",

They suggest that nicotine stimulation of cholinergic pathways in macrophages could tip the balance toward controlled inflammation rather than runaway immune activation. They emphasize that their suggestion is theoretical, not clinical advice, and that many variables (dose, timing, receptor expression, comorbidities) complicate the idea.",

			"Text": "SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 share some superficial similarities—they are both enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA viruses with spike glycoproteins mediating entry—but differ substantially in their replication cycles, host interactions, and immune evasion strategies. SARS-CoV-2 does not integrate into the host genome, replicates in the cytoplasm with proofreading, and uses ACE2 (plus proteases) for cell entry, leading to a relatively faster replication cycle. In contrast, HIV-1 reverse-transcribes its RNA, integrates into host DNA, uses CD4 plus co-receptors for entry, has high error rates (hence high diversity), and establishes latent infection, which makes eradication extremely difficult. Because of these mechanistic differences, their interactions with the immune system diverge: HIV-1’s dense glycan shield, latent reservoirs, and high mutation rate impede development of broadly neutralizing antibodies, while SARS-CoV-2 tends to be more “open” to vaccine-elicited neutralizing immune responses, despite also evolving escape variants.",

Viral transcriptional signatures persisted in stool for days after clearance from the respiratory tract, suggesting prolonged quiescent GI infection and a potential role in fecal–oral transmission. Patients with high fecal viral activity had stool microbiota enriched in opportunistic pathogens (Collinsella aerofaciens, Collinsella tanakaei, Streptococcus infantis, Morganella morganii) and showed increased bacterial functional capacity for nucleotide, amino acid biosynthesis, and glycolysis. In contrast, those with low or no viral activity had more short-chain fatty acid–producing bacteria (Parabacteroides merdae, Bacteroides stercoris, Alistipes onderdonkii, Lachnospiraceae species), which are linked to immune regulation.",

Long COVID is associated with a sustained abnormal activation of the complement system (both classical and alternative pathways) that doesn’t return to baseline, unlike in people who recover. In addition, those with active Long COVID show elevated markers of blood cell damage, platelet activation, and monocyte-platelet interactions, all hinting at ongoing inflammation and coagulation (thromboinflammation). The study also found that higher antibody levels against herpesviruses might be contributing to triggering the classical complement pathway. The results point to specific protein signatures in blood that could serve as biomarkers to distinguish Long COVID patients from recovered ones, and suggest that complement and coagulation pathways are potential therapeutic targets.",

By amplifying overlapping viral DNA fragments, co-transforming them into yeast for in vivo recombination into a yeast artificial chromosome, and using T7 polymerase–mediated in vitro transcription, the authors were able to reconstitute infectious virus in cell culture. They demonstrate this method’s effectiveness with SARS-CoV-2 and other RNA virus families, and show that recombinant viruses replicate with kinetics similar to isolates and that the genomic constructs are stable over yeast passages. This platform reduces the delay between sequence release and functional virus generation, enabling faster experimental characterization of emerging variants or engineered modifications (e.g. reporter insertions), which is especially valuable during outbreak response. The authors propose this as a general, rapid reverse-genetics tool for RNA viruses, facilitating downstream studies (e.g. pathogenesis, antiviral testing, vaccine design).",

			"Text": "This BMJ clinical review outlines how to recognise and manage cognitive dysfunction after covid-19 in primary care. Cognitive complaints—commonly memory, attention and concentration problems—are frequent in long covid, fluctuate over time and can substantially limit daily life and work. Many patients improve within a year, but persistence beyond 12 months predicts slower recovery. Evidence on mechanisms is still mixed and heterogeneous. The article recommends a structured assessment: document symptom pattern and functional impact, exclude alternative explanations and red flags, and recognise that routine screens may miss executive-function deficits. Management is supportive—education, pacing and energy management, sleep optimisation, vocational accommodations, cognitive rehab/compensatory strategies, and addressing comorbidities—while acknowledging the absence of proven disease-specific pharmacologic treatments.",

			"Text": "Mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 N gene (specifically in the region targeted by the N1 qPCR probe) can lead to significant underestimation of viral RNA levels in wastewater surveillance using RT-qPCR. The authors combine mutation detection in field wastewater samples over 2021–2022 with controlled experiments using mutant synthetic templates to show that even a single nucleotide change in the probe binding region can reduce assay sensitivity. As a result, N1 results can be depressed relative to N2, particularly during later Omicron waves when such mutations became common. The authors argue that reliance on a single qPCR target is risky in the face of viral evolution. They recommend multiplexing assays, ongoing assay validation, and quality control protocols to ensure wastewater surveillance remains accurate even as SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge and mutate.",

In Zika-infected mice, neurological disease tracked with NKG2D⁺ CD8⁺ T-cell infiltration into the brain, not with how much virus was present. Blocking these CD8⁺ cells or their NKG2D receptor prevented paralysis, while cytokine stimulation (IL-12/18) lowered viral load but worsened neurological symptoms, indicating antigen-independent “bystander” cytotoxicity as the damaging mechanism. Thus, CD8⁺ T cells acting through NKG2D can drive neuropathology during viral infection, making this pathway a promising therapeutic target.",

			"Text": "This review compares influenza and SARS-CoV-2 in the respiratory tract, examining how viral tropism, host immune responses, and tissue damage intersect to produce a spectrum of disease severities. While the host immune response is essential for clearance, it can also drive pathology, particularly when dysregulated. Influenza binds to sialic acids on epithelial cells (mostly upper airway), with avian vs. human adaptation defined by α2,3 vs. α2,6 linkages. SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 (with TMPRSS2 and other proteases assisting entry), expressed in subsets of ciliated cells, type II alveolar cells, and other epithelia. This narrower receptor distribution partly explains distinct tissue targets and pathogenesis. Influenza tends to infect upper respiratory tract cells more readily (though severe strains can descend into alveoli). SARS-CoV-2 can infect both upper and lower respiratory tract, with significant consequences in alveolar regions and vascular compartments — this contributes to severe pneumonia and ARDS-like pathology. Influenza has a short incubation period (1–2 days) and rapid onset of symptoms, so transmission peaks around or after symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2 has a longer incubation (4–6 days) and allows pre-symptomatic transmission, which has major implications for pandemic spread. Influenza typically induces a brisk interferon response, sometimes protective but also damaging if excessive. SARS-CoV-2 often shows a blunted or delayed interferon response, with later excessive inflammation (e.g., cytokine storm) contributing to pathology. Influenza usually causes epithelial necrosis and damage in conducting airways, with repair via proliferation of basal and alveolar type II cells. SARS-CoV-2 often involves diffuse alveolar damage, endothelial injury, microvascular thrombosis, and sometimes long-lasting epithelial dysplasia or fibrosis — more extensive and protracted repair failure than typical influenza.",

The stronger associations are observed at longer follow-up intervals (around one year), and more severe COVID-19 may further increase the risk compared to milder cases. The authors note, however, that this increased risk is not clearly higher than risks seen after other respiratory infections like influenza. Because the studies included vary greatly in their design, dementia definitions, follow-up durations, and adjustment covariates the conclusions should be interpreted cautiously.",

			"Text": "Lung cancer and COVID-19 share a number of dysregulated genes, particularly 36 genes whose expression is altered in both disease contexts. These genes cluster in biological processes tied to cell cycle control, DNA repair, immune modulation, and cellular stress responses. Through network analyses, the authors highlight several genes (hub nodes) as potential key mediators, and explore candidate drug compounds that might target these genes or their pathways. Overall, the study suggests that COVID-19 may aggravate lung cancer progression via shared molecular mechanisms, and that some of these molecules may be actionable in the context of co-morbid disease. However, the study is limited in that it is purely computational and based on secondary (public) transcriptomic datasets; there is no experimental or clinical validation of the proposed signatures or drug targets. Moreover, because the datasets derive from different sources (with potential batch effects, differences in sample handling, heterogeneity of patient populations), the overlap of genes may partly reflect technical or sampling artifacts rather than true biological intersection. The approach also does not resolve causality (i.e., whether COVID-19 drives those changes in lung cancer, or vice versa). Finally, since the analysis focuses on lung cancer patients and shared genes, the findings may not generalize to noncancer populations or reflect complexities of the in vivo microenvironment (e.g., spatial heterogeneity, tumor–immune cell interactions).",

Within the tumor xenografts, virus persisted, accumulated mutations (predominantly in the spike protein), and certain variants arose that showed greater replication in the Calu-3 environment without cytopathic effect. When tested in K18-ACE2 mice, the variant isolates were attenuated (less lethal) relative to the parental strain, yet induced cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity upon rechallenge. This model demonstrates how SARS-CoV-2 can evolve under prolonged replication pressure in a permissive tissue niche, yielding variants with altered replication–virulence trade-offs. However, because the host mice are immunodeficient and lack immunological selective pressures, and because the experiment spans only 30 days, the extent to which the mutations and dynamics recapitulate persistent infection in humans is uncertain.",

For viruses like HPV, HBV and MCV, integration of viral DNA into host genomes is a pivotal carcinogenic trigger that elevates oncogene expression; activation yet manipulation of DNA damage response pathways (e.g., ATM/Chk2) further enables transformation. Given decade-long latencies, the authors highlight opportunities for prevention and early interception but note that antioxidant strategies remain unproven. ",

In engineered mouse lungs that already carry EGFR/KRAS drivers, brief PM2.5 exposure promotes tumor formation via inflammation—especially macrophage-derived IL-1β—that shifts mutant AT2 cells into a regenerative, tumor-permissive state. Ultra-deep sequencing reveals that many “healthy” lungs already contain rare EGFR or KRAS driver mutations, implying that pollution mainly promotes cancers from existing clones rather than initiating them. This promotion model helps explain lung cancer in never-smokers and underscores the value of air-quality policies and potentially anti-inflammatory interception strategies targeting IL-1β.",

In contrast, a more hormone-dependent breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) was less responsive to direct M protein treatment in terms of proliferation and metastasis. Moreover, M protein–treated aggressive BCCs can exert paracrine influences on otherwise non-aggressive BCCs, driving them toward more malignant phenotypes via secreted cytokines and EMT induction. The findings raise the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 infection might exacerbate breast cancer progression, particularly in TNBC patients, and suggest that inhibition of NFκB or STAT3 pathways might ameliorate such adverse effects.

Because the cohort was small, observational, and confined to Delta-era HCWs, and because outcomes were PCR RNA rather than cultured virus or transmission events, the findings mainly highlight a possible short-term kinetic disadvantage of short-interval ChAdOx1 boosting—not a definitive statement on infectiousness or on other vaccines/variants.",

Patients infected with the Delta variant had more severe lung injury patterns compared to those with Alpha or Omicron, and individuals vaccinated with at least two doses had lower risk of CT-detectable lung injury. Interestingly, younger patients (<18 years) were less likely to exhibit lung abnormalities, but the extent of lung injury on imaging did not clearly alter treatment outcomes in this cohort. The authors suggest that CT imaging might help detect otherwise subclinical lung damage in COVID-19, even in cases classified clinically as mild, to better guide management and prevent complications. They also interpret that non-Omicron strains tend to impose more lung burden and that vaccination confers a protective effect on lung involvement. However, they note that imaging findings do not necessarily translate into worse outcomes and should be interpreted in clinical context.",

Over half of those antibody-positive cats also had measurable neutralizing activity. There was no clear correlation between seropositivity and respiratory symptoms or typical demographic factors. The study supports the notion that spillover from humans to cats occurred during the early pandemic, even if cat infections were largely subclinical. The study is limited by its modest sample size and the fact that the cats were drawn from an animal hospital population rather than a randomized community sample, raising potential sampling bias. Temporal sampling was uneven, and the high prevalence in fall 2020 may reflect selection or outbreak effects rather than stable prevalence. The study is cross-sectional (with limited longitudinal follow-up), so it cannot resolve directionality of transmission (e.g. cat-to-human) or dynamics of viral shedding.

			"Text": "This study profiled post-mortem brainstem, cerebellum, and olfactory tissues from individuals who died of COVID-19 at different disease stages using single-nucleus transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics, and proteomics. In acute cases, the brainstem showed a pronounced type I interferon inflammatory response that was attenuated in late-phase cases. Spatial mapping revealed two patterns: a neuronal response centered on cranial nerve nuclei and a diffuse perivascular pattern involving oligodendrocytes, microglia, and astrocytes. The authors infer that local immune reactions, likely triggered by systemic inflammation, can disturb brain function without ongoing viral persistence in the CNS. This provides a plausible explanation for neurologic symptoms during and after acute infection and emphasizes neuroinflammation—not direct neurotropism—as a key mechanism.",

The risks were higher among those with more severe COVID-19, and analyses over time showed that the risk of asthma and bronchiectasis continued rising while risks for COPD, ILD, PVD and lung cancer declined. In those with SARS-CoV-2 reinfection versus a single infection, the hazards for respiratory outcomes were even more elevated (e.g. asthma HR ~3.0).",

Patients with viral presence had significantly lower plasma levels of the anticoagulant PROS1, and among them, those whose tissue was positive for virus had even lower PROS1 than those without.

About 21.4% of residents had a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and 1.5% required hospitalization. The 30-day mortality among confirmed infections was 1.6%, declining over time (from 11.4% early 2020 to 0.4% in early 2022), while among hospitalized patients the 30-day mortality was 10.8%, decreasing from 14.0% to 6.0% over the same period. Risk of death was higher with older age, male gender, greater socioeconomic deprivation, and underlying comorbidities, reflecting consistent predictors of worse outcomes. The authors present this as a framework for cross-regional comparisons of COVID-19 burden. However, limitations include possible underascertainment of infections, reliance on administrative coding, lack of variant-level or long-term outcome analyses, and limited generalizability to other settings.",

Using ~20 LTL‐associated SNPs and large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) datasets from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (e.g. 38,984 cases vs 1,644,784 controls for susceptibility), the authors found no significant associations in either direction, and no detectable genetic correlation between telomere length and COVID-19 outcomes. Sensitivity analyses and alternate instrument sets yielded consistent null results. While observational studies had linked shorter telomeres to more severe COVID-19, the MR evidence here argues against a strong causal role of telomere length (as proxied by common genetic variants) in COVID-19 risk or severity—at least in European ancestry populations. The authors caution that their power is limited (instruments explain only a small proportion of LTL variance), and nonlinear effects or contributions of extremely short telomeres cannot be excluded.",

Blood profiling in 76 acute COVID patients showed graded increases in inflammatory and endothelial/coagulation markers with severity, and higher S100β in those with brain fog. Structural MRI (vs 60 healthy controls) found reduced brain/white-matter volumes and increased CSF in brain-fog patients, with BBB disruption correlating with these changes. Mechanistically, PBMC RNA-seq suggested coagulation dysregulation and dampened adaptive immunity in brain-fog; long-COVID PBMCs adhered more to brain endothelium, and patient serum or S1 spike protein activated endothelial cells (↑TNF/TGFβ/ICAM1/VCAM1). The authors propose that sustained systemic inflammation plus focal BBB dysfunction underlies cognitive symptoms and highlight TGF-β as a candidate biomarker/target.",

The authors survey plausible biological mechanisms—viral persistence, immune dysregulation, endothelial/microvascular injury, latent virus reactivation, autonomic dysfunction, and metabolic disruption—while emphasizing that long COVID is likely heterogeneous rather than a single uniform disease. They call for deeper mechanistic, tissue-based, and longitudinal studies to discriminate causal drivers from secondary signals. They also highlight that some early empirical findings support components of this framework (e.g. persistent viral antigens in plasma, viral RNA in tissues), but emphasize the urgent need for stronger causal evidence, standardized cohorts, biomarker platforms, and interventional trials.

Convalescent plasma lowered PD-1 on T cells from healthy donors, and IFN-γ neutralization restored PD-1 on CD8+ cells. Spike protein—but not nucleocapsid—provoked IFN-γ responses only in convalescents (ELISpot n=6). Single-cell analyses and perturbation experiments suggest IFN-γ reduces PD-1 via the AKT/GSK3β pathway (AKT agonism and inhibition modulated PD-1 and p-GSK3β accordingly). About 35% reported lingering symptoms.

			"Text": "In a study of 30 Long COVID patients (symptoms > 3 months), 10 recovered COVID individuals, and 20 healthy controls, the authors report that megakaryocytes (MKs) in Long COVID patients are more frequent in peripheral blood (0.28 ± 0.05% vs. 0.03 ± 0.02% in healthy) and carry both SARS-CoV-2 single- and double-stranded RNA and Spike protein. These virus-harboring MKs appear to produce platelets that also contain viral RNA and Spike, and microclots were observed in all Long COVID participants. Additionally, about 30% of Long COVID patients had detectable Spike protein in plasma (at picogram levels), and levels of platelet serotonin and the enzyme TPH-1 were significantly reduced in LC versus recovered individuals.",

			"Text": "In a large Norwegian cohort (~112k people with known test status; ~153k questionnaires), self-reported memory function (Everyday Memory Questionnaire (EMQ), 0–4 scale) was consistently worse after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test than after a negative test, across 0–36 months. Adjusted mean EMQ scores for positives vs negatives were 0.66 vs 0.60 at 0–1 month and 0.82 vs 0.62 at 12–18 and 18–36 months; the two groups were similar before testing (0.61 vs 0.60). Worse scores tracked with more days bedridden (e.g., 1.29 if >13 days). The authors emphasize these are mild deficits on average and self-reported. Limitations include potential recall and response bias, residual confounding, and lack of objective cognitive testing. Still, the pattern suggests a persistent association between COVID-19 and perceived memory problems up to three years post-infection.",

Conventional echocardiography was normal in both groups. These findings suggest a cardiac autonomic imbalance—with relative parasympathetic predominance—as a physiologic correlate of long-COVID symptoms in youth.",

			"Text": "In a virology sub-study nested within the PANORAMIC trial, nonhospitalized, at-risk adults with early symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection were randomized to receive a 5-day course of molnupiravir (n = 253) or usual care (n = 324). Although molnupiravir accelerated viral decline during treatment (viral half-life ~0.41 days vs ~0.72 days in usual care), by Day 14 the molnupiravir group showed significantly higher viral RNA persistence and lower anti-spike antibody titers (~2,200 U/mL lower). Modeling suggested that to suppress viral RNA below detection in 95 % of patients might require a longer (≈10-day) regimen. Genomic sequencing revealed that molnupiravir-treated viruses carried increased mutational burdens (on average ~180 extra mutations, higher transition:transversion ratios) and greater diversity. Among residual virus, ~16.7 % of tested samples were culture-positive, with some viable virus detectable up to 9 days post-treatment. No strong signal of consensus-level spike escape mutations was found yet several recurrent substitutions in polymerase and nonstructural proteins emerged. The authors caution that the standard 5-day molnupiravir course may be too short, potentially risking persistence of mutated virus and attenuated antibody responses, and they suggest that longer treatment durations warrant investigation.",

They found that IL-1β was elevated in both COVID-19 groups, while IL-8 was elevated only in the nLongC group; BDNF and cortisol were also increased in both groups compared to controls. In nEVs, the nLongC group showed marked upregulation of proteins linked to neurodegeneration (Aβ42, pTau181, TDP-43, etc.), whereas the Cov group showed more limited changes (only Aβ40). These findings support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to chronic peripheral inflammation and sustained stress responses, and may drive pathological changes in neuronal vesicle cargo associated with neurodegeneration.",

A combined metric of AVR + vFID discriminated PCS patients from controls with area under curve = 0.75. Moreover, worse symptom severity correlated with lower AVR (R = –0.37, p = 0.017), and these microvascular abnormalities were more pronounced in PCS patients with elevated inflammatory biomarker levels (e.g. CXCL10, IL-6). The authors argue that persistent endothelial dysfunction in the microcirculation is a potential pathophysiologic hallmark of long COVID, potentially explaining enduring symptoms such as fatigue and cognitive impairment.

They show that one of the candidate “chimeric” Spike variants (Spike1 / RBD1) recapitulates binding energetics close to SARS-CoV-2’s RBD–hACE2 (–23.73 vs –24.7; –80.7 vs –81.2 kcal/mol) yet has much weaker binding to the P2C-1F11 neutralizing antibody (–22.7 vs –83.7 kcal/mol), suggesting that their method could have “foreseen” a SARS-CoV-2–like lineage from SARS-CoV-1. The authors argue that such in silico forecasting, combined with genomic surveillance and pre-emptive broad neutralization strategies, might reduce the severity of future SARS-CoV pandemics. However, the method is demonstrated only retrospectively, and there remain substantial uncertainties about how well computationally predicted lineages correspond to viable viruses in nature. The assay relies heavily on modeling assumptions, limited mutation frequency data, clustering heuristics, and idealized binding-energy estimates, without experimental validation or consideration of other evolutionary pressures (e.g. viral replication fitness, immune environment, host ecology). Thus, while conceptually interesting, the predictive power in real-world viral emergence remains speculative.",

The authors argue that beyond the acute infection, a residual human metabolic reprogramming / dysregulation (HMRD) can persist even when the virus is cleared, providing a unifying mechanistic basis for many of the multi-system symptoms observed in long COVID (PASC). They categorize PASC sufferers into four sub-phenotypes based on dominant organ impairments and link them to underlying metabolic derangements.",

			"Text": "This study examines how SARS-CoV-2 virions, even when neural infection is minimal, perturb synaptic structure and electrical activity in human-derived neural tissues. Using cerebral organoids, human brain explants, and post-mortem brains, the authors find that exposure to the virus increases expression of presynaptic proteins (Bassoon, LPHN3, FLRT3), induces abnormal presynaptic morphology, and disrupts local field potentials. Intriguingly, virions appear to accumulate at LPHN3–FLRT3 synaptic junctions, possibly interfering physically with synaptic homeostasis. Treatment with an LPHN3 agonist partially restores electrophysiological activity and corrects some morphological abnormalities. While viral replication in neurons is quite low, this work suggests that even non-productive presence of SARS-CoV-2 may have functional impacts on synapses.",

The promoting effect is lost when extracellular Ca²⁺ is removed, indicating the enhancement is calcium-dependent. The authors propose a mechanistic model where DAP binds to the S protein, associates with the host cell membrane, and facilitates viral entry.",

Distinct protein signatures correlated with different symptom clusters: IL-1R2, MATN2, COLEC12 for cardiorespiratory/fatigue/psychological phenotypes; MATN2, CSF3, C1QA for gastrointestinal symptoms; C1QA and nerve-repair proteins (SPON-1, NFASC) in cognitive impairment; and SCG3 (brain–gut axis) in gastrointestinal symptoms. They also saw that some individuals with long COVID maintained higher SARS-CoV-2–specific IgG levels, but viral RNA was not found in sputum, and nasal fluid inflammatory markers were not clearly tied to symptoms. The results support the idea that different mechanistic “subtypes” of long COVID exist, possibly reflecting tissue-specific damage or dysregulation, which may guide future targeted therapeutic strategies.",

Intranasal exposure led to weight loss, ~25 % mortality by day 9, and detection of viral RNA in lungs, brain, and eyes, whereas direct ocular exposure did not lead to lung infection or systemic disease, though viral RNA was still detectable in eyes. In vitro, BRB cells were permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with infection, viral receptor expression, and cell death exacerbated under hyperglycemic conditions. Moreover, chronic exposure to SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen (by intravitreal injection) led to observable retinal vascular and structural abnormalities—including microaneurysms, retinal atrophy, and vein occlusion—after 30 days, hinting that lingering viral antigen may contribute to ocular sequelae. The work underscores a potential route for retinal involvement in COVID-19 and suggests that comorbidities like hyperglycemia may worsen ocular vulnerability.",

			"Text": "According to this study by Novavax researchers, repeated administration of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines is associated with an increasing shift toward spike-specific IgG4 subclass antibodies, whereas a recombinant protein (Novavax) vaccine regimen did not show this IgG4 skewing. The protein vaccine induced much higher IgG3 levels (~10× vs mRNA) and stronger Fcγ effector activity than the mRNA homologous boosters. This class switching toward IgG4 in mRNA vaccinees raises concerns because IgG4 is known to have a lower ability to engage Fc receptor–mediated effector functions (e.g. ADCC, complement activation). Thus, although neutralizing binding may still be present, the shift could reduce the overall functional quality of the humoral response. The findings suggest that vaccine platform choice and booster scheduling may impact not just antibody titers but also antibody functional subclasses, with possible repercussions for long-term protection.",

In infected cells, the Golgi apparatus fragments rapidly—detectable by 6 h and complete by 12–24 h—leaving only ~2% of infected cells with an intact Golgi at 24 h versus ~97% of controls; in parallel, the ER condenses around replication sites in ~90% of infected cells versus ~2% of controls. The ER marker calnexin decorates double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), while Golgi protein markers disperse, even as Golgi-derived lipids appear within the replication organelle. Expression screening identified five viral proteins (M, S, E, ORF6, nsp3) that independently fragment the Golgi, with nsp4 also reshaping ER. M alone can generate DMV-like structures. Disrupting Golgi trafficking with brefeldin A inhibits replication, whereas nocodazole yields only a modest, non-significant reduction—implicating Golgi/ER trafficking as functionally important in coronavirus replication.",

			"Text": "Severe COVID-19 is often accompanied by marked lymphopenia, but the drivers of T-cell depletion are incompletely understood. In this study, the authors show that a specific progenitor subset, TCF1⁺ CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T-cells, declines preferentially with disease severity (e.g. from ~53% in mild to ~32% in severe in the CD8⁺ compartment) and that this decline correlates negatively with severity (Spearman r ~–0.58). The loss is not mirrored in TCF1⁻ cells, suggesting selective targeting of progenitor populations. Further, in patients with severe disease, residual TCF1⁺ cells show impaired proliferation (lower Ki67), reduced expression of Bcl-2 (a pro-survival factor), and a new subpopulation of TCF1⁻, caspase-3⁺ cells hinting at apoptosis. The authors show that serum from severe patients suppresses TCF1 transcription in healthy T cells ex vivo, and that blockade of IL-12 rescues this effect, implicating an IL-12–mediated suppression axis. They argue that this mechanism may underlie T-cell pool collapse in severe COVID-19, and propose IL-12 blockade (or related strategies) as a potential therapeutic angle.",

			"Text": "This review addresses how HIV infection modifies the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and affects COVID-19 outcomes. It emphasizes that people living with HIV (PWH) are immunologically heterogeneous: many on ART recover well, but up to ~30 % fail to normalize CD4 counts and retain chronic immune dysregulation. Epidemiological data largely suggest similar SARS-CoV-2 infection incidence in PWH and HIV-negative persons, but PWH with poor HIV control (low CD4, detectable viral load) face higher risk of severe COVID-19 and mortality. Immunological studies show that PWH with good immune function often mount T-cell and antibody responses comparable to uninfected people, but those with advanced HIV may produce weaker and less durable responses, and may fail to clear SARS-CoV-2 promptly. Prolonged viral shedding (median ~109 days in some cases) and intrahost viral evolution have been documented in immunocompromised PWH. COVID-19 vaccination is generally safe and beneficial in PWH, but efficacy and durability are reduced in those with immunosuppression, and booster prioritization is recommended.",

In two of the RNA-positive patients, the local expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1β was strongly elevated (one with ~55-fold and ~110-fold increases, another ~7-fold) relative to patients without detectable SARS-CoV-2 in cardiac tissue. These cytokine elevations were confirmed by immunofluorescence in cardiac sections but were not reflected in systemic serum levels, suggesting a localized inflammatory response. Thus, the authors propose that persistent viral colonization of cardiac tissue might contribute to ongoing local inflammation even months after apparent recovery, which could have implications for long-term cardiac sequelae in COVID-19 survivors.",

Of those, 25 developed interstitial lung disease, with 8 fatal outcomes, while the others exhibited features of autoimmune disease (myositis, Raynaud’s, rashes). Few had documented prior COVID-19 infection, and over half had received SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Through transcriptomic comparisons, the study showed that IFIH1 (MDA5) expression is induced in COVID-19 and in autoimmune ILD (but not in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), correlating with type 1 interferon and IL-15 signaling and activated CD8⁺ T cell signatures. A protective IFIH1 rs1990760 TT genotype dampened this response in some individuals. The authors propose a new COVID‐associated syndrome (termed “MIP-C”) linking viral exposure, aberrant MDA5 induction, and autoimmune lung injury.",

			"Text": "This review by Zhang et al. (2024) systematically surveys how SARS-CoV-2 exploits host cell factors at every stage of its life cycle — from receptor binding (ACE2, DPP4, AXL, NRP1/2, CD147) and proteolytic activation (TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, cathepsins, furin) to hijacking of intracellular translation, trafficking, metabolic, and epigenetic machinery — to facilitate replication and propagation, while suppressing host immune defenses (e.g. via NSP1). The authors then link these host–virus interactions to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 across multiple organs (lungs, gut, liver, kidney, reproductive tissues) and hypothesize how persistent dysregulation (e.g. fibrosis, metabolic reprogramming, senescence, chronic inflammation) may underlie long COVID. They propose that therapeutic strategies should include host-targeted agents (e.g. inhibitors of proteases, metabolic enzymes, translation factors, or RNA-G-quadruplex stabilizers) which might have advantages over direct antivirals (e.g. broad spectrum, reduced resistance). However, they caution that many host factors perform essential physiological functions, and that most evidence to date is derived from in vitro or computational studies, with limited in vivo or clinical validation.",

The authors reaffirm that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via airborne routes and present a dose-response pattern: better compliance and mask quality yield greater protection. They further find that mask mandates are associated with lowered community transmission, and that respirators outperform medical or cloth masks in controlled comparisons. However, the authors acknowledge limitations: many RCTs in this field suffer from heterogeneity (different settings, masking strategies, compliance levels) and sometimes low infection prevalence, which can bias toward null effects. Some interventions are difficult to blind or enforce.",

After full adjustment, there was no statistically significant difference in overall developmental score (ASQ-3 total). However, exposed children had greater odds of delays in social–emotional domains (OR ~3.58–3.81), higher ASQ:SE-2 scores, more respiratory symptoms (mean LRSQ z = 0.3), and greater use of inpatient (38% vs 21%), outpatient (38% vs 30%) and GP services (60% vs 50%). While these findings suggest that perinatal SARS-CoV-2 exposure might be linked to social-emotional developmental delay and increased respiratory morbidity in early childhood, the study is constrained by its modest sample size, potential selection bias from low enrolment, reliance on parent-reported measures rather than clinical assessments, and only ~2-year follow-up.",

Across three centers from 2018 to 2023, 151 fetuses with LR asymmetry were identified (overall incidence ~0.85 ‰). Intriguingly, incidence remained low (0.17–0.63 ‰) from 2018 to 2022, but surged to 3.24 ‰ in 2023, coinciding with a large wave of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a case–control subset (30 cases and 30 matched controls), the infection rate in mothers was 96.67% in the case group versus 73.33% in controls; first-trimester infection (especially around gestational weeks 5–6) was strongly overrepresented (96.6% in cases) and was associated with odds ratio ~13.07 for LR asymmetry. The authors conclude that SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first trimester may significantly increase the risk of fetal LR asymmetry, with cardiac malformations as the most frequent associated structural anomaly (observed in ~90.9% of dysmorphic fetuses with concurrent malformations).",

This effect reduces the host’s ability to produce antiviral and antigen-presentation proteins such as IRF7, OAS3, and HLA-B, while inflammatory cytokine genes (IL6, TNF) remain unaffected. These results suggest that the virus selectively disables antiviral defense while preserving inflammatory signaling, potentially explaining the immune imbalance seen in severe COVID-19. By integrating transcriptomic and proteomic datasets, the study further finds that unproductive transcripts correspond to decreased protein translation, and that viral proteins physically interact with the same host systems they disrupt. The work proposes that SARS-CoV-2 evades immune detection by simultaneously hijacking host RNA splicing, nuclear export, and translation machinery.",

Examination of the placenta revealed high viral RNA loads (genomic N1) and subgenomic E RNA, and in situ hybridization detected both the positive S gene strand and negative orf1ab strand, indicating active viral replication in placental tissue. Histopathology showed placental injury consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because the infant was delivered by cesarean section and handled under sterile precautions, and given the maternal infection and the evidence of replicating virus in the placenta, the authors argue this represents vertical (in utero) transmission of the Delta variant. As a single case, it cannot quantify incidence or risk, but it suggests that under conditions of high viral load and variant virulence, the placental barrier may be breached.",

While the incidence of new post-acute sequelae (PASC) diminished over time in both groups, meaningful residual risk remained into year 3: in non-hospitalized persons, ~9.6 DALYs per 1,000 were attributable to PASC in that year; in hospitalized persons, ~90.0 DALYs per 1,000. Across 3 years, hospitalized individuals bore a substantial burden of additional sequelae (≈ 252.8 per 1,000) compared to controls. This work shows that the health burden of COVID-19 does not fully resolve within 3 years, especially in people with severe (hospitalized) acute disease, though risks decline over time.

			"Text": "In this study, Tarke et al. assess how symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections (after vaccination) reshape T cell immunity. In a cohort of vaccinated individuals (n = 27) with available pre- and post-infection samples, they observed that BTI leads to significant boosts in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses against Spike in people lacking prior non-Spike reactivity, and induces new or expanded T cell responses to non-Spike viral proteins (M, N, nonstructural proteins). Moreover, variant-specific mutation-containing epitopes emerged post-BTI, constituting about 9–15% of the recognized epitope repertoire. These findings suggest that breakthrough infection broadens and deepens the antigenic scope of T cell immunity beyond the vaccine target. Importantly, the study found no evidence of T cell functional exhaustion in these boosted responses; rather, T cells became more polyfunctional (producing multiple cytokines and cytotoxic molecules). While neutralizing antibody titers also improved modestly, the dominant signature of BTI was on enhancing T cell magnitude and diversity. The effects were consistent across infections during Delta and Omicron waves, indicating that BTIs can extend vaccine-induced immunity by augmenting cellular memory even against variant-mutated regions.",

In five vaccinated advanced-HIV participants studied longitudinally, viral clearance aligned with the rise of neutralizing antibodies (live-virus FRNT_{50}); measured CD8 T-cell responses did not track with clearance, and CD4 T cells weren’t reliably measurable due to low counts. Complete HIV suppression wasn’t strictly required at clearance, but was important for effective vaccine responses. Persistent infections showed within-host viral evolution and neutralization escape (notably from a Delta infection), although evolved viruses did not escape contemporary population-level neutralizing immunity. Overall, the data indicate that in advanced HIV disease recovering on antiretroviral therapy (ART), neutralizing antibodies are the key proximate correlate of clearing persistent SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the dual individual and public-health value of restoring humoral immunity and maintaining suppressive ART.",

Influenza patients more often had respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, hypoxemia, and underlying comorbidities; in contrast, COVID-19 patients were more likely to present with lymphopenia, elevated CRP, radiological bilateral infiltrates, and being overweight. Although more influenza patients met the threshold for severe disease on admission (NEWS ≥ 5 in 43.4% vs 19.1%), key outcomes — including length of stay, need for ventilatory support, in-hospital mortality, and 30-day mortality — were not significantly different between the groups. These findings suggest that while influenza tends to manifest more severely at entry from a respiratory standpoint, COVID-19 exhibits lab and radiologic features that may help differentiate it early in hospitalization.",

Behavioral assays over 15 days revealed that mice receiving IgG from LC1 or LC3 developed persistent mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity, whereas mice receiving control donor IgG regained normal thermal sensitivity within 2–3 days. One subgroup (LC2) IgG did not provoke hypersensitivity but reduced locomotion transiently. Human IgG was detectable in multiple mouse tissues (spinal cord dorsal horns, DRG, muscle, heart) in all groups without clear intensity differences. Taken together, the results suggest that in some patients, IgG may be a causal (or contributory) mediator of sensory abnormalities in Long COVID, supporting an autoimmune hypothesis.",

Early antiviral treatment with nirmatrelvir or molnupiravir successfully lowered viral load and lung inflammation, but crucially did not prevent the neurological pathology, suggesting that neuronal damage may be decoupled from ongoing virus presence and instead sustained by chronic inflammation or degenerative cascades. To connect these findings to human neurological diseases, the authors conduct transcriptomic overlap analyses between SARS-CoV-2 datasets and multiple neurological disease datasets, identifying overlapping DEGs, hub regulators (e.g. MAPK14, FOS), miRNA/TF regulatory networks, and candidate drugs (e.g. NADH, FADH, phenelzine).

However, sperm quality was significantly impaired early after infection: e.g. 60% of men tested <1 month had progressive motility < 32%, and 37% had sperm concentration < 15 million/mL. DNA damage (via fragmentation index and high DNA stainability) was also elevated early. Over time, the proportion of men with abnormal parameters declined; by >2 months post infection, only ~28% had low motility and ~6% low sperm count. Higher titers of anti-spike and anti-RBD IgG correlated inversely with motility and sperm count.",

At 6–8 months, ~80% of samples still had detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (albeit lower). In subsets, they demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2–specific memory B and T cells persisted in all tested individuals at 6–8 months, supporting the idea that adaptive immune memory from natural infection endures over this timeframe.",

			"Text": "Across human nasopharyngeal swabs, human autopsy tissues, and two animal models (hamster and mouse), the authors show that SARS-CoV-2 disrupts mitochondrial biology in a stereotyped way. In nasopharyngeal samples, as viral titers fall, the virus is linked to suppression of nuclear-encoded OXPHOS genes, induction of miR-2392, activation of HIF-1α and glycolytic programs, and engagement of host stress/immune pathways—consistent with a metabolic shift away from oxidative phosphorylation. In autopsy tissues where virus was no longer detectable, mitochondrial transcription had recovered in lung, but remained suppressed in heart (and, to a lesser extent, kidney and liver), while mtDNA transcription and immune defense signatures were increased—suggesting organ-specific persistence of mitochondrial dysregulation after viral clearance. In hamsters, during early infection (peak lung viral load), lung mitochondrial transcripts were minimally perturbed, but were down-regulated in cerebellum and up-regulated in striatum despite no detectable brain virus, indicating a systemic signal impacting the CNS. In mice, mid-phase infection showed partial recovery of lung mitochondrial transcription. Collectively, the data support a model in which an early systemic host response is followed by viral suppression of mitochondrial gene transcription and a glycolytic shift, with tissue-specific recovery or persistence thereafter.",

In the corridor—where over 30% of staff did not strictly wear N95 masks—virus RNA was detected in the air, whereas in the ward and lab (with universal N95 use) airborne viral RNA was not detected. These findings suggest that robust, universal N95 use in indoor hospital settings suppresses aerosol presence of SARS-CoV-2, thereby shifting or reducing the airborne transmission potential.",

The authors classified infection trajectories into abortive, transient, or sustained categories, and found that individuals who rapidly mounted local mucosal immune infiltration (especially in nasal tissues) were more likely to clear virus without sustained replication. Importantly, systemic (blood) interferon responses often preceded detectable mucosal responses, and higher baseline expression of HLA-DQA2 in nasal tissue correlated with resistance to sustained infection. They also uncovered that ciliated epithelial cells are a key permissive target with dynamic immune transcriptional changes, and that T cells and macrophages in the nasopharynx may harbor non-productive viral uptake. Through detailed profiling, they resolved 54 T cell states, including clonally expanding, antigen-responding subsets.",

The analyses reveal sex-specific pathways: in men destined to develop LC, upregulated TGF-β signaling in proliferating NK cells during acute infection; in women with persistent LC, enhanced IL-1 signaling in monocytes and increased expression of XIST at 12 months. Across both sexes, convergent immune signatures in LC include reduced monocyte co-stimulation, elevated NF-κB transcription factor expression, increased T cell exhaustion (LAG3), lower ETS1 expression across lymphocytes, and elevated intracellular IL-4 in T cells, suggesting a shift toward Th2-biased responses.

Functionally, patients’ immune cells had blunted type I (IRF7, IFNB1, ISG15) and type II (IFN-γ) interferon responses to TLR7 stimulation, consistent with a defect in antiviral innate immunity. The authors conclude that rare TLR7 variants may predispose certain young men to severe disease—though causal inference is limited by the small, observational design.",

Those with such hypoxia showed significantly lower oxyhemoglobin, more fatigue, greater depression, reduced quality of life, and worse performance on neurocognitive tests (processing speed, working memory, verbal fluency) compared to both healthy controls and recovered individuals without hypoxia. This suggests that in some people, lingering microvascular or inflammatory brain alterations post-COVID may impair local oxygen delivery and contribute to cognitive symptoms. The authors note that hypoxia might be part of a feedback “hypoxia–inflammation” loop, and that fdNIRS could help identify individuals at risk of long-term neurological sequelae.",

The strength of these correlations is weaker or differently patterned in female patients, implying a sex-biased reorganization of humoral immune control. The authors propose that this imbalance between regulatory Tfr cells and extrafollicular B-cell networks helps explain observed sex differences in COVID-19 antibody responses. Overall, the findings support a mechanistic hypothesis that in males, a loss of regulatory restraint (via cTfr) may favor extrafollicular B cell pathways, potentially contributing to dysregulated antibody responses, whereas females maintain a more balanced regulatory/effector ratio.",

Infection was associated with higher hazards of HPV-related invasive cancers—cervix (HR 1.67), vagina (2.31), vulva (1.99), anus (1.92), and oropharynx (1.78)—and similarly elevated risks for the corresponding carcinoma-in-situ lesions (HRs 1.34–1.96). Patterns were largely consistent across age and race strata. The authors propose immune dysregulation after COVID-19 as a plausible link but did not test mechanisms.",

			"Text": "This study reveals a conserved signaling axis by which inflammatory or stress signals in the brain communicate directly to skeletal muscle, bypassing neural circuits. In flies and mice, CNS stress (due to bacterial infection, SARS-CoV-2 protein expression, or amyloid-β) triggers ROS accumulation in the brain, which induces expression of Upd3 (in flies) or IL-6 (in mice). The cytokine then travels systemically and activates JAK-STAT signaling in skeletal muscle, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced energy production, and impaired motor performance. Interfering with IL-6 or JAK-STAT in muscle rescues the dysfunction, supporting the functional importance of this axis. They also conducted rescue and inhibition experiments: interfering with IL-6 or JAK-STAT signaling mitigated the muscle dysfunction phenotype, supporting causality. Their results extend to chronic brain stress models (e.g. amyloid β) and suggest that even after infection clearance, the reduced muscle performance effect may persist beyond the acute CNS insult.",

Nearly all infected HCWs (257/262) had been vaccinated, largely with inactivated vaccines, but the group with first infections had a much higher proportion receiving four vaccine doses (23.8% vs. 3.7%). The average time between first infection and reinfection was about 149.9 days (±11.9). Symptoms in reinfections were generally milder: fever occurred in 50.9% (vs. 83.2% in first infections), myalgia in 37.9% (vs. 56.4%), and rhinorrhea was more frequent in reinfections (60.9% vs. 45.5%).

In a mouse model, preinfection with SARS-CoV-2 increased susceptibility to a low-cytotoxic S. aureus strain: coinfected mice had worse outcomes and higher bacterial burdens, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 impairs host defenses in a way that favors secondary bacterial infection, including by strains with relatively weak virulence.",

Symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and fatigue were on average worse at 2–3 years compared to 6 or 12 months, indicating both persistence and new onset in some individuals. Importantly, later symptom severity was not well predicted by the acute illness severity, but was strongly linked to the 6-month recovery profile (explaining ~35–49% of variance), and to a “biocognitive” signature (acutely high D-dimer relative to CRP). Objective cognition at 2–3 years was mainly predicted by cognition at 6 months (explaining ~10.6% variance). Around 26.9% of participants changed their occupation (often for health reasons), and those occupational changes were specifically associated with both objective and subjective cognitive decline (OR ~1.5 per decrement in cognitive score).",

Many MIS-C children with anti-SNX8 antibodies also carry cross-reactive CD8⁺ T cells that bind both the viral and self epitopes; at least 17% of MIS-C sera are SNX8-autoreactive by strict testing (≈37% with broader criteria). Several cross-reactive TCRs were cloned/validated; estimated circulating frequencies are ~10⁻⁴–10⁻⁵ of CD8⁺ T cells, and binding fits HLA-A*02. This supports molecular mimicry as a mechanistic link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and a subset of MIS-C. Limitations include small T-cell experiment Ns, focus on HLA-A*02–restricted epitopes, and heterogeneity (many MIS-C cases lack SNX8 reactivity), so this is not a universal explanation.",

			"Text": "In a Colombian cohort of 100 patients with neurologic post-COVID sequelae (50 previously hospitalized, 50 non-hospitalized), researchers found that brain fog (60%) and fatigue (74%) were the most common persistent symptoms, along with myalgia, sensory disturbances, sleep problems, and anxiety. The hospitalized group had more frequent abnormal neurologic exam findings (64% vs. 42%), while the non-hospitalized group performed worse on executive function testing (T = 42.6 vs 48.5). Both groups had deficits in processing speed and attention compared to normative populations. Symptomatic anxiety and depression were associated with worse cognitive performance and quality of life. Importantly, brain fog and fatigue persisted across durations of Long COVID, and exploratory modeling suggested incremental monthly increases in risk for depression, tinnitus, anxiety, and brain fog with longer symptom duration. The authors argue that neurologic manifestations of Long COVID are frequent, long-lasting, heterogeneous, and present even after 'mild' acute disease.",

The onset of symptoms was most often when first tested or by 3 months, and older adolescents (15–17 years) were disproportionately represented among those with lingering cognitive issues.

Parallel studies in mice infected with Omicron subvariants (BA.5.2, BQ.1) reveal similar mitochondrial disorganization in cardiac tissue, with cristae density reductions (to ~9–15 µm⁻¹ versus ~32 µm⁻¹ in healthy controls) and differential expression of mitochondrial transport proteins (e.g. TOM/TIM family, ADP/ATP translocases).",

While influenza and tetanus responses were readily found within the LLPC compartment (mean ~7.3 % and ~2.1 % of total IgG ASCs, respectively), SARS-CoV-2–specific ASCs were essentially excluded from LLPCs (mean ~0.14 %) and instead were largely located in non-LLPC cell subsets (PopA/PopB). Only 6/17 individuals had detectable SARS-CoV-2 ASCs in LLPCs, and those were at very low frequencies. The authors argue that this lack of SARS-CoV-2–specific LLPC seeding helps explain why serum antibody titers decline within 3–6 months post-mRNA vaccination, whereas influenza/tetanus antibodies remain more stable. They found that the ratio of non-LLPC : LLPC for SARS-CoV-2 (~29) far exceeded that for influenza (~0.61) or tetanus (~0.44). T",

Paradoxically, the frequent infection group displayed higher IgG levels to certain variants (e.g. B.1.617 and BA.4/5) and stronger neutralising antibody activity against Omicron sublineages, indicating that their humoral immunity was intact or even enhanced. These findings suggest a dissociation between humoral and cellular immunity in this subgroup: despite robust antibody responses, a blunted T cell cytokine signature (IFNγ / IL-2) might predispose to repeated symptomatic infection.",

			"Text": "This study explored why some individuals maintain stable anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels (“sustainers,” n = 14) while others show rapid decline (“decliners,” n = 13) by deeply profiling B and CD4+ T cell subsets ~4–6 weeks after mild COVID-19. Although both groups had broadly similar frequencies of virus-specific B and T cells, the sustainers had a lower frequency of IgG+ memory B cells early after infection and showed a progressive enhancement in neutralization potency of RBD-directed antibodies over ~5 months, a pattern consistent with ongoing germinal center-driven affinity maturation. The decliners, by contrast, had relatively more early memory B cell output but did not improve neutralization capacity over time. CD4+ T cell magnitudes and phenotypes did not differ significantly between groups. Distinct correlation patterns between B, T, and serological metrics in each group suggest different B–T cell interaction dynamics in sustainers versus decliners. Overall, the results imply that durability of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses may depend on differential germinal center programs, in which some individuals favor sustained plasma cell generation and high-affinity maturation rather than memory B cell output.",

Patients with RNAemia had markedly higher in-hospital mortality (50.0% vs. 13.7%) and 180-day mortality (57.1% vs. 19.7%). After adjustment for age, disease severity, sepsis, lymphocyte and platelet counts, and CRP, RNAemia remained an independent predictor of 180-day death (HR ≈ 2.75). The study also showed that higher plasma viral RNA loads were associated with increased mortality and elevated systemic inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10). The authors propose that RNAemia reflects systemic viral dissemination and greater inflammatory injury, making it a useful biomarker for long-term mortality risk in elderly COVID-19 patients.",

This effect is explained by epitope masking: high-affinity mAbs bind key spike epitopes and block B cell receptor access, thereby redirecting the endogenous B cell response away from those epitopes. Encouragingly, this reduction in neutralization capacity can be reversed with booster immunization. In human infection settings, the authors show that in individuals treated with mAbs during SARS-CoV-2 infection, alteration of the endogenous humoral response is observed predominantly in those who had not yet initiated their natural immune response when the mAbs were given. Together, these observations suggest that therapeutic or prophylactic anti-spike monoclonal antibodies can interfere with the host’s own antibody maturation when given early, but that this interference is not absolute and can be at least partially overcome by additional vaccination.",

Importantly, infection alters neuronal gene expression: 10 genes implicated in apoptosis, inflammation, metabolism, and antigen presentation were significantly dysregulated (e.g. upregulation of IL-6, BAX/BCL2, CD147, S1PR1 and downregulation of HLA-A, ERAP1, ANG).

The authors report that eHHV-6B carriage (~0.35%) is associated with increased risk of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), and among SLE patients, eHHV-6B positivity correlates with markedly higher disease activity (average SLEDAI 30.5 vs 6.0, P = 1.3×10⁻⁸). Integration mapping places HHV-6B into a locus on chromosome 22q, and immune profiling suggests distinct immune activation patterns in eHHV-6B positive patients. Meanwhile, high anellovirus load is strongly associated with SLE, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and COVID-19; for example, in SLE the adjusted odds of anellovirus infection is ~58.5 (95% CI 15.6–293). Association signals also extend to certain clinical features (e.g. complement levels, immunosuppressant use).",

Each additional early-life infection was also associated with a small but measurable rise in later risk (AIRR ~1.05 for infections, ~1.02 for antibiotic use).

Inhibiting MLCK (ML-7) significantly reduced syncytia incidence and size, whereas ROCK inhibition did not.

Apoptotic signaling (elevated caspase‐3) and inflammatory mediators (HMGB1, TNF-α, phospho-NF-κB, caspase-11, pannexin-1) were significantly increased, while pyroptosis markers (caspase-1, IL-1β, gasdermin D) were unchanged. Pre-treatment with the P2X receptor inhibitor Brilliant Blue G ameliorated the muscle damage and dampened molecular inflammation, implicating purinergic signaling in the pathogenic process. This work suggests that SARS-CoV-2, even in a non-replicative form, can trigger acute myopathic effects via inflammatory and apoptotic pathways, and that targeting purinergic signaling may protect muscle from viral-induced injury.",

Predictive models performed well (e.g., AUC 0.90 for concordant patient+clinician improvement). In a biomarker subset, antivirals were associated with rapid 15-day decreases in GFAP (p=0.012; n=9) and NFL (p=0.0078; n=9), whereas anticoagulants left GFAP/UCHL1 unchanged and increased NFL (p=0.017; n=12).",

Very few (1.8 %) reported full resolution of Long COVID, and even among those, modest lingering impairments remained relative to never-affected individuals. Greater vaccination (i.e. more doses) was associated with better outcomes across multiple measures. The authors did not find a strong effect of illness duration on severity once Long COVID was present.",

They found that PCC participants had significantly lower pulmonary perfusion (median 49 vs 78 mL/min per 100 mL; P < .001) and slightly lower regional ventilation (P = .047). In symptomatic PCC patients, metrics such as flow-volume loop correlation (FVL-CM) were reduced, and ventilation and perfusion defect percentages were higher than in controls. Moreover, in the PCC group, greater lung perfusion correlated with worse fatigue (ρ = 0.48, P = .009) and higher ventilation–perfusion mismatch correlated with higher heart rate (ρ = 0.44, P = .02). These findings support a distinct “lung perfusion phenotype” in pediatric long COVID, potentially contributing to symptoms.",

Microglial P2Y12R loss scaled with regional viral RNA (e.g., medulla r = −0.87), and snRNA-seq of 16,260 nuclei identified nine cell populations reflecting inflammatory state shifts. The picture is one of “gliovascular failure” at sites of vascular inflammation and Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) injury, with glutamatergic terminal loss. Inflammation in brain and CSF was dominated by IL-1/IL-6 signatures tightly coupled to systemic inflammation (e.g., spleen IL-6 vs medullary IL-6 r = 0.93; lung IL-1β vs CSF IL-1β r = 0.87).

Risk of long COVID was higher for women, younger participants (<50 years), low socioeconomic status, severe acute disease, obesity, elevated pre-vaccination IgG, and preexisting chronic or mental health conditions.

Without functional peroxisomes, macrophages overactivate the inflammasome and produce excess IL-1β, triggering accumulation of dysplastic epithelial progenitors (KRT8^high) and promoting lung fibrosis. In mouse models, pharmacological enhancement of peroxisome biogenesis ameliorated both acute lung injury and post-acute sequelae (PASC), supporting a causal role for macrophage peroxisome dysfunction in chronic lung pathology after SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Across both designs, COVID-19 was consistently associated with worse semen quality: lower total sperm count (e.g., 173.63×10^6 → 131.80×10^6 post-infection), reduced motility (grade-A 8.50% → 2.61%; progressive 24.88% → 19.82%; total 32.25% → 26.64%), and higher DNA fragmentation (26.49% → 32.10%). Morphology and chromatin immaturity were unchanged. Within-person comparisons showed deterioration in 58–75% of COVID-positive men (vs <40% in negatives), strengthening the association.",

They marshal clinical correlations showing that higher total IgE and SARS-CoV-2–specific IgE levels associate with disease severity, lung damage, and hypoxia, and that in fatal COVID-19 cases, high IgG4 levels (> 700 mg/dL) are common, with autopsy lung samples showing 80–90 % IgG4 expression during acute disease. They further argue that repeated exposure (e.g. booster vaccinations) could skew immunity toward IgG4, impairing effector functions (complement activation, Fc-mediated phagocytosis) and potentially promoting viral persistence or chronic infection (and possibly long COVID).",

Multivariate analyses separated post-COVID lipidomes from both controls and acute-phase COVID, and the paired comparison identified 170 dysregulated lipid features. Pathway enrichment suggested persistent perturbations in sterol, bile acid, isoprenoid, and fatty ester metabolism, including elevated phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins.

Bed rest leads to overt muscle atrophy, lower mitochondrial content (succinate dehydrogenase), and compensatory capillary changes. By contrast, patients do not show global atrophy, but instead display a shift away from type I (oxidative) fibers, intrinsic mitochondrial dysfunction beyond simple mitochondrial loss, and relatively lower capillary supply for a given fiber size (especially in ME/CFS). These findings argue against the idea that long COVID / ME/CFS exercise intolerance is simply due to deconditioning. Instead, intrinsic muscle and microvascular abnormalities likely contribute.",

Critically, in human patients with prolonged (> ~196 days) loss of smell, the authors detected viral RNA and infected cells in the olfactory mucosa alongside elevated inflammatory markers (e.g. IL-6), supporting the hypothesis that viral persistence and chronic inflammation in the olfactory epithelium may underlie long-lasting anosmia in COVID-19.",

The authors further demonstrate in vitro that SARS-CoV-2 can directly induce neutrophils from healthy donors to adopt a LOX-1⁺, PD-L1⁺ suppressive phenotype (without productive infection), capable of repressing T cell proliferation. Early expression of LOX-1/PD-L1 in patients was associated with worse disease progression. The authors suggest that neutrophil reprogramming into immunosuppressive PMN-MDSCs may contribute to immune dysfunction in severe COVID-19, and that targeting PD-L1 might help restore immune competence.",

While prior autopsy work suggested viral persistence in fat, this analysis of living donors found no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 persistence months to years after infection. Instead, transcriptional remodeling occurred during the subacute phase—marked by suppressed immune signaling and up-regulation of Hox and integrin genes, which may affect adipose metabolism and systemic inflammation. Despite these short-term molecular changes, adipose tissue from Long COVID patients (>1 year post-infection) was transcriptionally indistinguishable from controls. Thus, subcutaneous adipose tissue likely contributes to transient inflammatory dysregulation following acute infection but does not drive Long COVID pathophysiology.",

Responses also depended on viral lineage: the Gamma (P.1) variant yielded ~17× lower viral load than the original B lineage in visceral adipocytes and induced up-regulated interferon-signaling proteins, whereas the B lineage down-regulated interferon-pathway proteins and strongly increased cytokines (e.g., TNF-α >100-fold). The work supports adipose tissue—especially visceral fat—as a potential extrapulmonary reservoir and inflammatory driver in COVID-19, while noting in-vitro and sampling limitations and the absence of clinical outcome data.",

The authors observed this mechanism across multiple human organs in COVID-19 and replicated it in mouse ischaemia-reperfusion and SARS-CoV-2 infection models—watching the “endo-seal” form in real time. When modest, the seal prevents bleeding; when excessive, it aggregates RBCs and occludes microvessels, explaining COVID-19 microangiopathy. The human set included 8 autopsies sampling 5 organs each, with post-mortem delays 12–48 h (one 216 h case excluded from injury metrics). Kidney, liver, and heart showed dominant RBC-membrane–driven obstruction in COVID-19, lungs did not. Endothelial Mlkl deletion in mice reduced haemolysis, obstruction, and tissue injury, pointing to necroptosis/complement as therapeutic targets—beyond standard anticoagulation, which targets platelets/fibrin that were not central here.",

By doing so, nsp15 dampens host innate immune sensing and signaling, thereby promoting viral replication and pathogenicity in lung epithelial cells and in vivo models (hamsters, K18-hACE2 mice). In K18-hACE2 mice, the wild-type virus (with intact nsp15 activity) caused higher mortality and evidence of neuroinvasion, whereas EndoU-inactive mutants were attenuated and largely confined to the respiratory tract. Viruses carrying inactive nsp15 were attenuated: they stimulated stronger antiviral responses, had lower replication, and caused lower mortality. These findings support a mechanistic role for nsp15 in immune evasion and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.",

In a retrospective subset of 29 ICU COVID-19 patients, 17% exhibited retinal hemorrhages or cotton wool spots during their hospitalization.",

			"Text": "This preprint reviews evidence that many inflammatory and vascular conditions—including acute and Long COVID, ME/CFS, sepsis, and neurodegenerative diseases—feature fibrinaloid (amyloid) microclots that resist normal fibrinolysis and can obstruct capillary flow. In parallel, nailfold capillaroscopy (NFC) frequently shows decreased capillary density/length and flow, increased tortuosity/meandering, and microhaemorrhages in these same conditions. The authors argue that NFC (functional) and microclot assays (structural) are complementary and should be combined with endothelial biomarkers for stronger disease assessment.",

			"Text": "In a German online cohort of 1,405 adults ( 910 prior-infected; 495 never-infected), the authors tested cognition and mental health and found a selective deficit in hippocampus-dependent mnemonic discrimination among those with prior COVID-19. On the Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST; N = 151), prior-infected participants showed lower lure discrimination (LDI)—a signature of impaired pattern separation—while item recognition was preserved, and the effect remained after adjusting for age, sex, education, depression, anxiety, and stress. Longer time since infection correlated with worse LDI. A Corsi forward (visuo-spatial working memory) deficit was also observed and correlated with LDI, whereas other attention/executive tasks showed little or no group differences. The authors interpret this as behavioral evidence consistent with hippocampal (DG) vulnerability—potentially via neuroinflammation and disrupted neurogenesis—after SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

While overall brain volumes did not differ, focal atrophy was found in right basal ganglia and limbic regions, and cortical volume reductions in paralimbic areas (insula, temporal cortex). Diffusion metrics revealed microstructural damage (lower FA, higher RD) especially in tracts like the uncinate fasciculus and cingulum, with more pronounced changes in those who had been hospitalized. Functional connectivity differences emerged only in the more severe group, whereas cerebral blood flow differences were not observed. The findings support a model in which post-COVID neurological and cognitive symptoms may stem from selective disruption of basal ganglia–limbic–cortical networks, rather than diffuse global injury.",

These changes occurred in mild, moderate, and severe cases alike. The cytokine milieu revealed strong inflammatory activation, with IFN-γ, IL-6, and TNF initially elevated and partly subsiding by day 7 in the older Portuguese cohort, while younger Brazilian patients continued to show heightened inflammation. The authors suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection can accelerate immunosenescence—normally a hallmark of aging—within days. This may impair antiviral responses, heighten susceptibility to complications, and contribute to the broader “inflammaging” observed in COVID-19. The effect’s presence across age and severity groups implies that even transient infection episodes can impose long-lasting immunological aging pressure.",

Median MoCA was 25, fatigue was common (FSS 5.64, 53.6% above cut-off), and assessments occurred a mean 5.3 months after infection. These convergent imaging–neurophysiology findings suggest anterior network dysfunction underlies cognitive complaints in post-COVID patients, even after non-severe acute illness.",

In human donor retinas from individuals who had COVID-19 (but no prior dementia diagnosis), they also found elevated amyloid-β accumulation compared to non–COVID controls, to levels comparable to Alzheimer’s cases. Mechanistically, they showed that blocking the receptor neuropilin-1 (NRP1), which is used by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for entry, attenuated the amyloid-β deposition induced by spike protein in retinal explants, implicating spike–NRP1 interaction in driving or enhancing amyloid-β aggregation.",

The authors found persistent dysregulation in both myeloid and lymphoid compartments (e.g. altered expression of CD39, CD57, TIGIT, CD64, CD11b), with particularly elevated CD57 on CD8⁺ T cells in formerly critical COVID-19 patients. While seropositivity to BCG or latent infections (CMV, T. gondii) was somewhat less common in the more severe COVID cohorts and showed a non-definitive trend toward better outcomes in sepsis, ex vivo stimulation of monocytes from convalescents or BCG-vaccinated individuals did not show robust differences in cytokine responses. Despite the evidence of immune remodeling long after acute infection, the study did not support the hypothesis that BCG vaccination in childhood confers lasting trained immunity detectable in adult monocyte function.",

They found that the previously infected mice sustained more severe liver injury (elevated ALT, vacuolated hepatocytes) than controls despite having lower blood alcohol levels but higher acetaldehyde accumulation. The data suggest that prior SARS-CoV-2 infection causes persistent upregulation of hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes (notably CYP1A2 and CYP2E1), which likely enhances conversion of alcohol to acetaldehyde, increasing hepatotoxic stress. Mechanistically, elevated TNF-α expression was linked to upregulation of transcription factors (aryl hydrocarbon receptor and Sp1) which bound to promoters of CYP1A2 and CYP2E1, respectively, driving their increased expression. No significant intestinal damage was observed in the model. The authors conclude that SARS-CoV-2 infection may reprogram hepatic metabolic enzyme states in a way that increases susceptibility to further insults such as alcohol consumption, with potential relevance to long COVID and liver health.",

Compared to being unmasked, ESFM use reduced performance (median time to exhaustion decreased by ~150.5 s), lowered arterial oxygen saturation at peak intensity by ~3.7 %, and increased perceptions of air hunger and work of breathing (especially at submaximal intensities). Interestingly, while spirometric measures at termination were similar between conditions, during submaximal intensities some mid-expiratory flows (e.g. FEF 25–75, FEF₅₀) were modestly improved with the mask. An ESFM is protective of the lung, improving within-exercise respiratory function. However, these benefits need to be balanced with the degree of perceptual and physiological burden, elevating multiple sensations of dyspnea and inducing significant reductions in SpO2 at both submaximal and maximal exercise intensities.",

			"Text": "COVID-19 is not only a respiratory disease but also a vascular and thromboinflammatory disorder: SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a prothrombotic state via endothelial injury, complement activation, extracellular vesicles bearing tissue factor, platelet overactivation, and neutrophil extracellular traps, among other pathways. In acute COVID-19, pooled evidence shows ~21 % incidence of thrombosis (DVT ~20 %, PE ~8 %, arterial ~5 %) in hospitalized patients, and survivors carry elevated risks (e.g. ~1.2 % incidence of PE, ~2.3 % for DVT post-COVID, HR ~3.16 and ~2.55, respectively). Persistent microclots and procoagulant factors in long COVID may sustain vascular damage, establishing feedback loops of inflammation, coagulation and hypoxia. In terms of prevention and treatment, most trials to date have tested heparin or LMWH in hospitalized patients, with mixed results: therapeutic anticoagulation may improve survival in noncritically ill patients but raises bleeding risk, and in critically ill patients benefits are less clear. Only one trial has included children, and many guideline recommendations remain cautious, advising prophylactic anticoagulation in hospital settings and selective post-discharge use.",

			"Text": "🐹🧫This preprint describes a mechanism linking transient SARS-CoV-2 infection of olfactory epithelium (targeting sustentacular cells) to a prolonged, localized neuroinflammation in the olfactory bulb, mediated by degeneration of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and subsequent microglial activation. Using a hamster model and supporting human data, the authors show that viral RNA persists in the olfactory epithelium for ~10 days, while viral proteins clear by ~5 days, and that epithelial damage causes progressive OSN loss. Axonal debris accumulates in the olfactory bulb and triggers sustained transcriptional immune responses (e.g. phagocytosis, synaptic remodeling) in microglia, spatially restricted to the projections of the damaged OSNs. Thus, even after viral clearance and without direct infection of the brain, peripheral neuronal injury can lead to a durable glial inflammatory state. This suggests a plausible pathway for neurologic symptoms in long COVID that does not require persistent viral reservoirs in the brain. The model highlights a delayed injury-to-glia axis as a general principle by which transient peripheral insults might cause long-lasting changes in brain function.",

When recombinant Mᵖʳᵒ was added to plasma from 21 donors, the probability of clotting within 1 hour increased ~3-fold (p = 0.003). Using degradomics and N-terminomics (TAILS), the authors showed that Mᵖʳᵒ cleaves and activates FVII at Arg152–Ile153 and FXII at Arg353–Val354, i.e., the canonical activation sites that initiate the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. They also identify a secondary Arg-at-P1 specificity (~10%) in Mᵖʳᵒ, consistent with zymogen activation chemistry; an inactive Mᵖʳᵒ mutant did not induce clotting. Structural/biochemical support includes HDX-MS mapping of an Arg-containing inhibitor (PPACK, Ki ≈ 160 ± 2 nM) to Mᵖʳᵒ and partial inhibition by Argatroban (~20% activity reduction). Together, the data propose a viral-protease–driven pathway for COVID-19 coagulopathy that complements inflammation-based explanations and positions Mᵖʳᵒ as a mechanistic link to thrombosis—and a potential therapeutic target to explore.",

			"Text": "This pragmatic randomized crossover trial evaluated whether use of in-home HEPA air purifiers could reduce blood pressure in adults living near major roadways. In 154 participants (mean age ~41 years, baseline SBP ~118.8 mm Hg), each individual underwent one month of HEPA filtration and one month of sham (filter removed), with a washout period in between. The key finding was that among participants whose baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) was ≥ 120 mm Hg, HEPA filtration reduced SBP by 2.8 mm Hg while sham increased it by 0.2 mm Hg, leading to a net 3.0 mm Hg benefit (P = 0.04). No significant benefit was observed for diastolic BP or in those with lower baseline SBP. The study suggests that relatively modest improvements in indoor air quality may yield clinically meaningful BP reductions in populations exposed to traffic‐related particulate pollution, even in settings with comparatively low ambient PM₂.₅. However, the effect was limited to those with elevated SBP.",

In endothelial cells, ME/CFS IgG induced mitochondrial fragmentation; the effect disappeared when IgG was enzymatically cleaved, yet the Fab fragment alone recapitulated the energetic impact, while the Fc fragment alone produced a hypometabolic pattern with a trend toward lower ATP. Proteomic profiling of IgG-bound immune complexes differed by illness: ME/CFS complexes were enriched for pathways in extracellular-matrix organization, whereas PASC complexes pointed to hemostasis / clot-regulation processes. The authors conclude that patient antibodies may play a causal role in post-infectious disease biology by disrupting endothelial mitochondrial dynamics and modulating immune signaling, highlighting antibody-targeted strategies as potential avenues for therapy.",

			"Text": "This study developed a 3D in-vitro human skeletal muscle tissue model and exposed it to patient sera from ME/CFS and Long COVID patients. Within 48 hours exposure the tissues showed a marked drop in contractile strength alongside transcriptomic evidence of up-regulated protein translation, elevated glycolytic enzyme expression, disruption of calcium regulation, and mitochondrial hyperfusion. The early adaptive phase appears to boost metabolic activity and structural changes (hypertrophy) in response to the stress imparted by patient sera. However, upon extended exposure (96-144 hours) the model exhibited a transition to metabolic fragility: contractile strength further declined, myotubes became weakened, mitochondria adopted fragmented “toroidal” morphologies, and the compensatory mechanisms failed. The findings suggest that muscle weakness and fatigue in ME/CFS and Long COVID may reflect a biphasic process: a transient hyper-metabolic adaptation followed by collapse of mitochondrial and contractile resilience. The authors propose this supports a biological basis for fatigue and post-exertional malaise in these conditions.",

			"Text": "In the article, John M. Eyler examines biomedical science on the eve of and during the 1918-19 influenza pandemic. He shows that the scientific paradigm at the time relied heavily on bacterial theories of influenza (especially the supposed causative role of Haemophilus influenzae / Pfeiffer’s bacillus), and that numerous vaccines were developed and deployed during the pandemic, often in rushed or poorly controlled trials. Many of these vaccines yielded contradictory results, and no consensus existed on standards of efficacy. Eyler argues that the chaotic vaccine efforts and the inability to identify the correct etiologic agent (the influenza virus was unknown until 1933) triggered improvements in trial methodology and public-health practices. The 1918 pandemic thus became a watershed moment in epidemiology, microbiology, and vaccine science — not only because of its enormous mortality, but because it exposed foundational gaps in knowledge and helped shape the future of how epidemics are studied and responded to.",

Electron microscopy revealed lipid-droplet–rich Leydig cells and viral particles associated with lipid structures, supporting a model where SARS-CoV-2 hijacks steroidogenic/lipid machinery to replicate, at the expense of androgen production—aligning with reports of low testosterone/HDL in severe COVID-19.",

Although neutralization against the vaccine-matched KP.2 and a related JN.1 variant was decent (GMTs ~315 and ~203 respectively), neutralization of the more antigenically divergent variants dropped substantially (e.g., GMT ~60 for LP.8.1, ~29 for XFG) compared to ancestral strain (GMT ~733). Binding antibodies, however, remained high, suggesting maintained potential for protection despite reduced neutralization. Interestingly, participants with only vaccination history (no prior infection) showed broader cross-neutralization than those with hybrid immunity (infection + vaccination), possibly reflecting immune imprinting bias toward prior infecting strains. The antigenic map confirmed that the emerging variants are antigenically distant from KP.2, supporting the idea that current vaccine boosting predominantly amplifies pre-existing responses rather than adapting fully to newly drifted variants. The findings signal that updated vaccine antigens or new delivery strategies may be required to maintain protection as SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve.",

The magnitude of reduction differed by age, with minimal difference in children <10 years, and larger reductions in older age groups (e.g., HR ~0.25 for age 60–69). Prior infection and vaccination (particularly booster mRNA doses) further reduced the risk of severe outcomes. Importantly, the authors interpret that the observed reductions reflect both a lower intrinsic severity of Omicron (in unvaccinated individuals) and reduced vaccine effectiveness (i.e., more breakthrough infections) against Omicron compared to Delta. They emphasise that boosters maintain strong protection with breakthrough infections.",

Concomitantly, PASC participants exhibited elevated frequencies of cT_FH and MAIT cells and increased levels of cytokines such as LIF, IL-11 and HMGB-1, as well as higher autoantibody burdens.",

Quality of life, measured via the SF-36, was reduced across all domains compared to norms—particularly in vitality and social functioning. The study found that worse outcomes in disability/function and quality of life were significantly associated with having more comorbidities, fewer vaccine doses, and poorer self-rated recovery.",

			"Text": "COVID-19 increases the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) in the acute phase and is associated with later chronic kidney disease (CKD), making CKD a plausible renal manifestation of long COVID (long-term effects persisting ≥3 months). Patients with pre-existing CKD are more susceptible to infection, severe outcomes and, potentially, long COVID. Distinct renal entities linked to COVID-19 include COVID-19–associated nephropathy (collapsing focale segmentale glomerulosclerose (FSGS)) and increased reports of vasculitis. While case reports have described new or relapsing glomerular disease after infection or vaccination, large population-based studies have not confirmed consistent causal associations for most glomerulopathies; by contrast, vaccination is safe in CKD, lowers COVID-19 risk, and is associated with reduced long-COVID risk. Mechanistically, pathways that drive AKI during acute infection (direct viral effects, immune-mediated and endothelial injury, hemodynamic stress) may also underlie chronic kidney sequelae.",

			"Text": "This review synthesizes evidence that long-term or latent infections alter fundamental cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with aging — for instance, by forcing mitochondria to support pathogen replication, thereby degrading cellular energy and resilience; by engaging pathways like mTOR that tie metabolism, immunity and longevity; by promoting senescent cell accumulation and chronic low-grade inflammation; and by shifting epigenetic regulation and immune cell composition in ways that mirror older physiological states. The authors assert that these pathogen-driven changes may not just accompany aging but actively accelerate it. Secondly, they discuss how this revised perspective could reshape how we model aging and design interventions: recognizing infection history, pathogen persistence and immune‐metabolic disruption as core components of aging biology. They also stress that current diagnostics are insufficient to track these microbial contributions, limiting precision medicine approaches in aging and longevity.",

By screening a library of 1,280 FDA-approved drugs, they found that H1 receptor antagonists inhibited viral entry in cell culture, with an average IC₅₀ of ~2.4 µM for various SARS-CoV-2 mutants. Further, using authentic virus and humanized mouse challenge models, the study supports that antihistamine drugs can reduce infection in vivo, suggesting a potentially repurposable class of therapeutics for COVID-19.",

The signature mainly reflected altered collagen I and III metabolism, as well as fragments from proteins linked to coagulation (fibrinogen α/β), inflammation (calprotectin S100A9), and endothelial integrity (PGBM). The model accurately separated PASC from controls with > 95% sensitivity and specificity. These findings support that urine-based peptide biomarkers can detect systemic changes consistent with endothelial dysfunction and pro-inflammatory, pro-fibrotic processes in long COVID. However, validation in an independent UriCoV cohort three years post-infection did not replicate the signal (p = 0.15), likely due to differences in symptom severity, recruitment criteria, and timing of sampling.",

In comparing to other polymers, iota-carrageenan showed better antiviral performance, supporting its further investigation. However, these results are entirely in vitro and do not demonstrate clinical efficacy in humans for SARS-CoV-2. The study is limited by cell-line models (ACE2-HEK293, Vero B4) which may not reflect human airway physiology, absence of in vivo or human trial data, and potential conflicts of interest (some authors affiliated with a company producing the polymer).",

			"Text": "In a cohort of 32 vaccinated health-care workers (16 of whom subsequently had breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection), the study found that those who developed post-vaccine infection (PVI) exhibited significantly poorer spike-specific CD4⁺ T-cell responses at one month after booster compared to those who remained uninfected, despite similar antibody levels. They also displayed higher LAG-3 expression on T-cells, and a trend toward reduced central-memory CD4⁺ T-cells, suggesting a less effective cellular recall response. After natural infection, these individuals showed enhanced CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T-cell activation and expansion of NKG2C⁺ “memory-like” NK cells, indicating that breakthrough infection can rescue and broaden cellular immunity. The findings suggest that antibody titres alone are insufficient to predict susceptibility to breakthrough infection: the quality and magnitude of the T-cell (particularly CD4⁺) and NK-cell responses matter. Future work is needed to define whether low post-booster T-cell responses can be used to identify individuals at higher risk of breakthrough infection and whether boosting or other immunomodulation can mitigate this risk.",

The hazard ratio for MACE in all COVID cases was 2.09 (95% CI 1.94–2.25) and 3.85 (95% CI 3.51–4.24) for hospitalized cases. Moreover, COVID-19 hospitalization in people without prior cardiovascular disease conferred a risk equivalent to the risk in people with cardiovascular disease who had not had COVID-19. Additionally, the authors identified a genetic interaction: individuals with non-O blood types who were hospitalized for COVID-19 had a significantly higher risk of thrombotic events (HR 1.65, 95% CI 1.29–2.09) compared to those with blood type O (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.66–1.39). The authors suggest that prior severe COVID-19 should be considered akin to a cardiovascular risk factor, and that blood-type genetics may modify that risk.",

			"Text": "In this pre-print, the authors identify a mechanistic pathway by which the SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein Orf6 induces neuronal cell death. Through a screen of 22 viral proteins they found Orf6 to be highly cytotoxic in human cells. In human primary neurons infected with SARS-CoV-2 (multiplicity of infection (MOI) 0.1) they observed elevated phosphorylation of RIPK3 and MLKL — hallmark necroptosis markers — without significant activation of apoptosis, pyroptosis or autophagy. They further show that Orf6 physically interacts with the mitochondrial carrier homolog 1 (MTCH1) in neurons, leading to mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, loss of membrane potential, increased mitochondrial ROS, calcium overload, and neuronal death. Knock-down of MTCH1 or pharmacological inhibition of RIPK3 effectively rescued the neurons from necroptosis, supporting a causal role of this pathway. Importantly, they also analysed human hippocampal brain sections from five COVID-19 autopsy cases and found increased pRIPK3 in MAP2+ neurons and more TUNEL+ neuronal death than in controls, corroborating the in vitro findings in human tissue. The authors propose that this mitochondrial-mediated necroptosis pathway may contribute to the neurological symptoms and cognitive impairment observed in long COVID (neuro-PASC). They suggest the Orf6–MTCH1–mitochondria–RIPK3/MLKL axis offers a potential therapeutic target (e.g., RIPK3 inhibition) to prevent or mitigate neuronal damage from SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

After a 58-year-old index case, the authors report 10/10 additional severely ill, hospitalized COVID decedents with similar deposits detectable by β-amyloid IHC but thioflavin-S negative, consistent with diffuse/early rather than fibrillar plaques. A 39-year-old decedent with milder COVID showed only rare deposits. Because pre-COVID ARDS cases showed the same pattern, the authors propose hypoxia as a likely driver. They speculate that such deposits could play a role in COVID-related encephalopathy/“brain fog” and might be amenable to anti-amyloid treatments, but they present no interventional or clinical outcome data.",

They used [^18F]DPA-714 PET with arterial sampling to measure TSPO binding (a marker of microglial/astrocyte activation and macrophage presence) in both cerebral and extracerebral tissues. Although some individuals with persistent symptoms displayed elevated TSPO binding in selected regions, the overall group with complaints did not show a statistically uniform, heightened inflammatory signal compared to those without complaints. The findings indicate that persistent fatigue and concentration problems after COVID-19 are not clearly explained by a widespread, ongoing, high‐level neuroinflammatory or systemic inflammatory state (at least as captured by TSPO PET at ~2 years). The authors therefore conclude that while inflammation may contribute in some cases, it is unlikely to represent a single, dominant mechanistic driver for the majority of long-term complaint sufferers, underscoring heterogeneity in post-COVID symptomatology.",

Because of prolonged B-symptoms and imaging showing hypermetabolic axillary nodes, a lymph-node biopsy was done; subsequent 16S rRNA PCR and metagenomic sequencing identified Bartonella henselae DNA and RNA. Treatment with clarithromycin correlated with regression of lymphadenopathy on PET imaging and symptomatic improvement. The authors suggest that in patients presenting with post-COVID symptoms (especially with adenopathy) clinicians should consider alternative or co-existing diagnoses; moreover, they highlight the value of clinical metagenomics for uncovering “hidden” infections even without classic exposure history.",

Population signals include more shingles, short-term rises in bacterial infections following COVID waves, and some increases in autoimmune diagnoses—effects too persistent and widespread to be explained only by “immunity debt.” Mechanistically, studies suggest epigenetic reprogramming of bone-marrow progenitors (a trained-immunity-like state lasting ≥1 year) and persistent tissue-based T-cell activation with viral RNA in some individuals for up to 2 years—potential routes to ongoing immune dysregulation in a subset of the infected. The article stresses proportion: average effects are small but add up at scale, vaccination likely blunts risk, and practical mitigations (better indoor air, access to vaccines/antivirals, alertness for secondary infections) are sensible. It also underscores uncertainty: the evidence base is heterogeneous, many studies are observational with confounding, and robust never-infected controls are scarce—so stronger causal inferences will require large, prospective cohorts.",

They report that the pandemic infected approximately 4.1 million Italians (out of a national population of ~36–38 million) and caused about 500 000 deaths. They performed a mixed‐methods approach: (1) quantitative cross‐city regression analysis linking local influenza mortality with subsequent vote‐shares for Mussolini’s party and fascist politics, and (2) qualitative text‐mining of Mussolini’s newspaper Il Popolo d’Italia to examine themes of grievance and radical politics. They found that regions suffering higher excess mortality during the pandemic had significantly higher levels of pro-fascist support afterwards, consistent with the idea that acute health crises may fuel radical political movements. The historical text analysis echoed themes of “lost generation, disillusionment and betrayal” in the newspaper, further supporting their interpretation of how the pandemic’s unequal impact might have contributed to polarization.",

Because these cohorts focused on patients hospitalized between March 2020 and November 2021, the findings mainly pertain to post-hospitalization survivors rather than mild community cases.

The prevalence varied markedly by region (highest in South America at ~51%) and did not appear to diminish markedly over time — with estimates of ~35% at <1 year follow-up and ~46% at 1-2 years. The most commonly reported subtypes were respiratory symptoms and general fatigue (each ~20%), followed by psychological (~18%) and neurological (~16%) symptoms.

			"Text": "This PRISMA-style systematic review aggregates evidence from 161 studies (>2 million patients) showing that COVID-19 is a multisystem disease with persistent, interlinked mechanisms: cytokine-driven inflammation, endothelial injury, and thrombo-inflammation. The authors spotlight common laboratory patterns—IL-6 > 100 pg/mL (72%), elevated endothelial markers (87%), and D-dimer > 2000 ng/mL (46%)—as proxies for these pathways. Reported organ impacts include cardiovascular injury and thromboses, neurological and cognitive sequelae, kidney impairment, liver dysfunction, and GI manifestations, extending into the post-acute phase (Long COVID).",

			"Text": "This preprint reports that among 44 long-COVID patients and 14 matched controls, significant structural abnormalities were identified in brainstem and cerebellar peduncle regions. Specifically, the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP) showed marked volume reduction (219.74 vs ~347.03 mm³), and the middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) exhibited decreased fractional anisotropy (0.39 vs 0.45), both with p < 0.001 indicating impaired white-matter integrity and connectivity. These findings were associated with symptoms such as motor control problems, proprioceptive dysfunction and autonomic instability. The authors advance a novel “Broken Bridge Syndrome” hypothesis, suggesting that long COVID neurological symptoms may reflect a breakdown in the neural “bridge” linking brainstem and cerebellum, possibly mediated by neuroinflammation, CSF / 4th‐ventricle alterations, and auto-immune processes.",

			"Text": "🧫The study screens anti-HIV prodrugs TDF and TAF against SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture. TDF at 50 µg/mL reduced MOI 2 infection by ~2 log₁₀ (~100% inhibition) with ≥75% viability, while TAF displayed a clear dose- and time-dependent effect—~68% inhibition at 6.25 µg/mL, approaching ~100% at 50 µg/mL, with a modeled EC₅₀ ≈ 3.61 µg/mL. Inhibition increased across 24→96 h exposures. Literature-compiled indices cited by the authors include TDF EC₅₀ ~6.5 µM and TAF EC₅₀ ~0.98 µM in related systems. The authors suggest tenofovir prodrugs could be repurposed and speculate on long-COVID relevance due to TAF’s lymphoid targeting, but acknowledge key caveats: in-vitro Vero E6 data only, uncertainty that effective µg/mL levels are clinically reachable, cell-line limitations in TAF activation, and small-n/heterogeneous protocols.",

			"Text": "In a controlled human exposure study of 12 healthy adults, the authors showed that one hour of standing within 10 m of busy traffic significantly elevated personal black-carbon exposure and led to a measurable increase in the mean surface area of particles adhered to RBCs (p<0.001). The increase was mitigated when the same exposure was undertaken while wearing an FFP2 mask (p=0.002). Electron microscopy of RBCs confirmed the presence of metal-rich nanoparticles typical of traffic emissions, and parallel in vitro and animal models demonstrated similar RBC–particle interactions and systemic transport potential. These results highlight a novel systemic pathway by which inhaled traffic-related particulate matter can hitch-hike on RBCs, offering a mechanistic link connecting inhalation of fine particles with systemic dispersion. The use of RBC particle-load as a biomarker and demonstration of mask efficacy further suggest strategies for exposure reduction.",

			"Text": "This meta-analysis covering 18 randomised trials and 186,657 participants found that the studied novel SARS-CoV-2 vaccines reduced the risk of infection by about 70.5% overall (95% CI: 53.5 %–79.7 %) and lowered relative risk by ~84% compared to placebo. Among the vaccinated group 2.8% became infected versus 3.4% in the placebo group over a median follow-up of about 99 days. The authors interpret these results as equating to protecting roughly 771 individuals out of 1,000 from SARS-CoV-2 infection in the trial settings.",

			"Text": "This retrospective study of 123 pediatric long-COVID patients (mean 13.1 y, 51% male) described symptom patterns and trajectories in a dedicated clinic (Aug 2021–Nov 2023). At presentation, symptoms had lasted 0–24 weeks in 56%, 25–52 weeks in 28%, and >52 weeks in 16%. The most frequent complaints were fatigue (93%), headache (70%), exercise intolerance (53%), dizziness (44%), and brain fog (41%). Females had higher odds of dizziness, brain fog, palpitations, POTS, and cardiovascular-domain symptoms. Across 74 children with follow-up, mean symptom counts fell significantly over time (−5.3 at 6 mo, −5.8 at 6–12 mo, −4.7 at 12–18 mo, −3.9 at ≥18 mo; p < 0.001), though a subset remained impaired. Among those with known vaccine status, 80% had received a primary series; vaccine status at baseline did not relate to symptom duration (p = 0.4). Of 26 vaccinated after long-COVID onset, 7/17 with documented follow-up (41%) reported subjective improvement.",

			"Text": "In 61 adults about 8.6 months after mild COVID-19, researchers compared 31 with persistent smell loss to 30 normosmic controls using DTI MRI and olfactory testing. Whole-brain TBSS was negative, but ROI analyses found higher fractional anisotropy (FA) in the left amygdala and higher radial diffusivity (RD) in the right amygdala in the smell-loss group (FA 0.25 vs 0.24, p = 0.014; RD 7.1×10⁻⁴ vs 6.8×10⁻⁴, p = 0.03). Longer symptom duration correlated with higher mean diffusivity / axial diffusivity (MD/AD) in left amygdala and higher MD in left posterior piriform cortex. Patients with olfactory dysfunction had higher Patient Health Questionnaire 8 (PHQ-8) and General Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) scores (PHQ-8 9 vs 2; GAD-7 6 vs 1, both p < 0.001), and these scores correlated negatively with left amygdala FA, linking smell loss, amygdala microstructure, and mood/anxiety.",
