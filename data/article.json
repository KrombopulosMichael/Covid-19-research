Despite normalized glycocalyx dimensions, the Microvascular Health Score was significantly worse in long-COVID (2.72 vs 3.87 in controls; p = 0.002), and capillary recruitment was blunted (29% vs 70%), indicating a fixed, poorly adaptable microvascular bed. These abnormalities did not improve over time across ~1.5 years and were linked to neurocognitive complaints (lower density; p = 0.049).",

			"Text": "üêÅMild respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice, even without neuroinvasion, triggers persistent white-matter‚Äìselective microglial activation, reduced hippocampal neurogenesis, oligodendrocyte loss, and myelin degradation well after viral clearance. Elevated levels of the chemokine CCL11 are found in cerebrospinal fluid/serum of infected mice, and systemic CCL11 treatment in na√Øve mice reproduces microglial reactivity and blunted neurogenesis. In human post-COVID cases with lingering cognitive (‚Äúbrain fog‚Äù) symptoms, plasma CCL11 levels are higher than in those without such symptoms, and postmortem brain tissue shows increased microglial reactivity in white matter compared to controls. By comparing with mild influenza infection, the authors show that while some neural changes are shared, the persistence of white-matter microglial activation and oligodendroglial/myelin loss appears more sustained in the SARS-CoV-2 setting. These findings suggest mechanisms linking even mild COVID infection to enduring cognitive deficits via neuroinflammation, white-matter injury, and chemokine-mediated microglial dysregulation. However, limitations include small human sample sizes, correlative human findings, lack of stratification by age/variant/vaccination, and reliance on a specific mouse model that may not capture the full spectrum of human disease.",

All strains and variants tested (Wuhan, Gamma, Delta, Omicron/BA.1, and the ORF7ab‚Äêdeleted mutant) showed ability to infect (or at least presence of virus) in the olfactory bulbs. Viral titers and RNA loads in olfactory bulbs were above detection for all groups. Evidence supports the olfactory pathway (sensory neurons in nose ‚Üí olfactory epithelium ‚Üí olfactory bulb neurons) as a route for brain invasion. No strong evidence was found for infection spreading via blood vessels or widespread brain infection beyond olfactory bulbs in this model. Retrograde and anterograde movement along axons was observed in in vitro neuron-epithelial systems. The original Wuhan strain caused the most severe clinical signs (e.g. weight loss), followed by Gamma, then Delta, and Omicron/BA.1 caused the mildest signs. Wuhan strain: high rate of full anosmia (complete loss) in many animals. Gamma: fewer full anosmia, but many animals had impaired smell. Delta & Omicron/BA.1: no detectable olfactory deficits in the behavioral test used ‚Äì they did not lose smell. Removing ORF7ab from the Wuhan strain reduced incidence of anosmia: only ~25% of animals with ORF7-deleted virus showed anosmia vs ~62.5% with wild-type Wuhan. However, deletion of ORF7ab did not reduce neuroinvasion: virus still reached olfactory bulbs, etc.",

This altered immunophenotype was mirrored by a reduced ex vivo T cell response to both non-specific and specific stimulation, revealing a dysfunctional status of T cells, including a poor response to SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Altered levels of plasma soluble PD-L1, as well as of PD1 promoter methylation and PD1-targeting miR‚Äì15-5p, in CD8+ T cells were also observed, suggesting abnormal function of the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint axis.

Random effects were used to estimate the pooled odds ratios (OR) and its 95% CI of different long-term symptoms between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. Five studies involving a total of 1643 cases, including 597 cases of asymptomatic and 1043 cases of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in this meta-analysis. The PPs of long-term consequences after asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections were 17.13% (95%CI, 7.55‚Äì26.71%) for at least one symptom, 15.09% (95%CI, 5.46‚Äì24.73%) for loss of taste, 14.14% (95%CI, ‚àí1.32‚Äì29.61%) for loss of smell, and 9.33% (95%CI, 3.07‚Äì15.60) for fatigue. Compared with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, asymptomatic infection was associated with a significantly lower risk of developing COVID-19-related sequelae (p < 0.05), with 80% lower risk of developing at least one symptom (OR = 0.20, 95%CI, 0.09‚Äì0.45), 81% lower risk of fatigue (OR = 0.19, 95%CI, 0.08‚Äì0.49), 90% lower risk of loss of taste/smell (OR = 0.10, 95%CI, 0.02‚Äì0.58). These results suggested that there were long-term effects of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as loss of taste or smell, fatigue, cough and so on. However, the risk of developing long-term symptoms in asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected persons was significantly lower than those in symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection cases.",

Results indicated that CSF proteome changes after infection resolution corresponded with bronchial virus abundance during early infection and revealed substantial differences between the infected non-human primates and their age-matched uninfected controls, suggesting these differences could reflect altered secretion of CNS factors in response to SARS-CoV-2-induced neuropathology. Infected animals exhibited highly scattered data distributions compared to their corresponding controls indicating the heterogeneity of the CSF proteome change and the host response to the viral infection. Dysregulated CSF proteins were preferentially enriched in functional pathways associated with progressive neurodegenerative disorders, hemostasis, and innate immune responses that could influence neuroinflammatory responses following COVID-19. Mapping these dysregulated proteins to the Human Brain Protein Atlas found that they tended to be enriched in brain regions that exhibit more frequent injury following COVID-19. It, therefore, appears reasonable to speculate that such CSF protein changes could serve as signatures for neurologic injury, identify important regulatory pathways in this process, and potentially reveal therapeutic targets to prevent or attenuate the development of neurologic injuries following COVID-19.",

The addition of exogenous ceramide after the downregulation of ASM by pharmacological inhibition restores infection with SARS-CoV-2. Thus, ceramide on the cell surface is necessary for infection with SARS-CoV-2. The ASM/ceramide system may be important not only for virus entry into the cell but also for the release of cytokines such as IL-6. Antidepressants reduce the level of proinflammatory cytokines in preclinical studies and patients with major depressive disorder. Importantly, reduced IL-6 levels were also found in COVID-19 patients treated with the FIASMA hydroxyzine. The ASM/ceramide system can help to explain the typical risk factors for a lethal COVID-19 course since ceramide abundance is increased in advanced age, hypertension or obesity, and the increased rate of thromboembolic complications in the setting of COVID-19 can also be explained by the ASM/ceramide system. The ASM/ceramide system may also help to explain the negative effect of chloroquine in the therapy of patients with COVID-19.",

Metformin has clinical benefits when used as outpatient treatment for COVID-19 and is globally available, low-cost, and safe. Overall, 93 (8¬∑3%) of 1126 participants reported receipt of a long COVID diagnosis by day 300. The cumulative incidence of long COVID by day 300 was 6¬∑3% (95% CI 4¬∑2‚Äì8¬∑2) in participants who received metformin and 10¬∑4% (7¬∑8‚Äì12¬∑9) in those who received identical metformin placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0¬∑59, 95% CI 0¬∑39‚Äì0¬∑89; p=0¬∑012). The metformin beneficial effect was consistent across prespecified subgroups. When metformin was started within 3 days of symptom onset, the HR was 0¬∑37 (95% CI 0¬∑15‚Äì0¬∑95).

This is associated with ongoing immune activation (particularly T cells) in various body regions. T cell activation doesn‚Äôt only occur in people with Long COVID symptoms. Certain tissues (gut wall, spinal cord) show stronger association with symptoms. That suggests some, but not all, of the immune activation may contribute to symptom persistence. The study investigated long-term tissue-level immune activation and viral persistence in people after SARS-CoV-2 infection, including in those with Long COVID symptoms. It uses imaging and tissue biopsies to look for evidence that virus or immune activation might linger long after acute infection. 24 people who had had COVID-19, imaged at times ranging 27 to 910 days after acute infection. Some had Long COVID symptoms, some didn‚Äôt. PET imaging using a tracer called [^18F]F-AraG, which specifically marks activated T lymphocytes. That allows anatomical quantification of T cell activation in various tissues. For a subset of Long COVID participants, colorectal tissue biopsies (rectosigmoid) were examined for presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via in situ hybridization, and via immunohistochemistry. Blood plasma protein profiling showed that people with more Long COVID symptoms (>5) and higher tissue uptake had elevated markers of immune activation/inflammation. In biopsied colorectal (rectosigmoid) tissue from a subset of Long COVID participants, SARS-CoV-2 RNA (spike gene) was detected in lamina propria cells. The period after infection ranged from ~158 to ~676 days. In spinal cord and gut wall in particular, the degree of T cell activation was associated with presence of Long COVID symptoms. Elevated activation in a variety of tissues, even long after infection (up to ~2.5 years). T cell activation (measured by PET tracer uptake) was higher in the post-acute COVID group compared to controls in many anatomical sites: brainstem, spinal cord, gut wall, bone marrow, hilar lymphoid tissue, cardiopulmonary tissue, nasopharyngeal tissue, etc. ",

Cognitive test used: spatial working memory from the CANTAB battery. Analyses: Volumetric_Œî: change in cortical/subcortical volumes pre‚Üípost COVID vs controls. Eigenvector Centrality_Œî (ECŒî): change in centrality in various brain regions (a measure from functional connectivity / network analysis) pre‚Üípost COVID vs controls.

In particular, reduced EC_Œî in the left amygdala was observed in the COVID+ group. COVID+ participants showed reduced performance in spatial working memory compared to controls post-infection. Importantly, the reduction in connectivity (EC_Œî) in the left amygdala mediated the relationship between having had COVID-19 and poorer spatial working memory. These effects were observed even though infections were mild and in young people; suggesting that even mild COVID-19 may lead to lasting structural/functional brain changes and modest cognitive changes.",

Molecular modeling (docking + molecular dynamics simulations) suggested that the Spike RBD of SARS-CoV-2 can bind to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of CD4, in a region that overlaps the ACE2 binding domain.

Infection of CD4‚Å∫ T cells altered their function: some effects on gene expression (immune response genes) and possibly exhaustion or changes that could affect helper T cell function.

The degradation products of tryptophan (kynurenine metabolites) are altered: specific patterns correlate with severity/symptomology. The enzyme IDO2 seems to be a driver of these changes.

			"Text": "Having had a prior Omicron infection (BA.1/BA.2) was associated with higher risk of reinfection with Omicron (likely BA.5) during this period, especially in the 9‚Äì29 days after the first Omicron infection. The hazard ratio for reinfection was very high in that early window. Those who got reinfected had lower neutralizing antibody titres (for both ancestral strain and Omicron BA.1), and lower anti-RBD IgG and IgA antibodies after their initial Omicron infection, compared to those who did not get reinfected. Time since last vaccine dose, age, sex, frailty, and number of facility outbreaks were not significantly associated with reinfection risk in the group already with prior Omicron infection. Some different vaccine brand combinations (mRNA-1273 vs BNT162b2) showed small signals of different risk, but overall hybrid immunity in this older cohort was quite heterogeneous. The study investigated 750 older adults (residents of long-term care and retirement homes) who were highly vaccinated (four doses of monovalent mRNA vaccine) to see how well hybrid immunity (vaccine + infection) protects against reinfection, particularly with Omicron subvariants. In a subset of 318 of these residents, immunologic assays were done (antibody levels, neutralization, T cell memory) in the three months before that observation period.",

			"Text": "Researchers analyzed biopsies of fungiform papillae‚Äîthe taste structures on the tongue in 16 individuals with long-term taste loss compared to pre-pandemic and never-infected controls. Using microscopy, immunofluorescence, and RNA in situ hybridization, they found SARS-CoV-2 proteins (spike and nucleocapsid) in the epithelial layers and lamina propria of the papillae. In several cases, negative-strand RNA was also detected, indicating active viral replication in taste tissue up to 40 weeks after infection. The infected papillae showed disrupted taste bud architecture, with missing or misshapen buds and a loss of neurite fibers that normally connect to sensory nerves. Patients with partial recovery over time displayed regrowth of nerve fibers and restoration of papilla structure, while viral protein clearance appeared patchy across the tongue. These findings provide strong evidence that long-term taste dysfunction in COVID-19 is linked to local viral persistence and structural damage rather than solely systemic inflammation. The results underscore that some Long COVID symptoms may stem from direct viral reservoirs in sensory tissues, highlighting the importance of exploring antiviral and regenerative strategies for treatment.",

This suggests that although antibody levels fall, the quality of the memory response improves over time. Additionally, antigen persistence in the gut appears to be present in 7 out of 14 individuals up to ~4 months post-infection.

They found that PCC patients had substantially slowed reaction times even on the simple task: large delays vs both control groups, consistent across both clinic sites. In SRT, many PCC patients fell multiple standard deviations behind controls. On NVT (more demanding), PCC patients showed slower responses (~150‚Äì200 ms slower than both No-COVID and No-PCC controls) and less vigilance.

At the same time, higher fusogenicity correlates with reduced neutralization by antibody reagents, meaning that immune pressure favors variants that can fuse infected cells into syncytia. Despite the replication cost of forming syncytia under low immune pressure, the authors suggest that the immune environment in the host selects for fusogenic spike variants. These findings explain why variants with more cell-cell fusion capacity (such as certain Delta or Omicron derivatives) are being selected, and highlight syncytia formation as a mechanism of immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2.",

In acute disease, markers of platelet activation and coagulation were elevated, and NETosis induction correlated with these and with how severe/long the disease was. Treatment (dexamethasone) and recovery reduce this induction. In long COVID, even after convalescence, patients maintain a heightened NETosis induction capacity despite having similar levels of NET fragments to other recovered patients.",

However, a significant fraction continue to have symptoms: about 7.5% report symptoms lasting 12 weeks or more (Long COVID), and ‚âà5.2% still have symptoms at 52 weeks or beyond. Key risk factors for longer symptom persistence include female sex, having pre-existing health conditions, more severe initial illness, earlier infection (wild-type variant), and higher socio-economic deprivation. Conversely, people infected during the Omicron-dominant period were much less likely to have persistent symptoms. Those with long-lasting symptoms report substantially worse quality of life, mental health, and more frequent, burdensome symptoms (such as fatigue, difficulty thinking or concentrating, breathlessness, loss of smell or taste) compared to both recovered COVID cases and people never infected.",

CD4+ T helper cells are similarly depleted in both, but COVID-19 shows much more severe depletion of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and NK cells. B cell counts are somewhat reduced in both, though not significantly different across the diseases. These distinct patterns suggest that while both viruses lead to lymphopenia, the immune dysregulation in COVID-19 involves more profound suppression of CD8+ T cells and innate immune NK cells, which may contribute to the acute disease severity.",

Neurodevelopmental evaluations at multiple time points revealed that about 20% of exposed infants had neurodevelopmental delays by 12 months, compared to under 6% in controls, giving a relative risk of about 3.44. These delays were particularly evident in fine motor and personal-social domains. The pattern of impairment varied over time in exposed infants: high at 4 months, low at 6 months, rising again at 12 months. 137 children were followed for one year: 69 with prenatal exposure (‚Äúexposed group‚Äù, EG) and 68 unexposed (‚Äúcontrol group‚Äù, CG). Neurodevelopment was assessed repeatedly (at 1,2,3,4,5,6,9,12 months) using the Guide for Monitoring Child Development in the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness context. For the exposed group, additional assessments at 4, 6, and 12 months used the Ages & Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-3). Demographics between groups were broadly similar.",

This suggests that both innate and adaptive immune dysregulation are involved in the brain injury that occurs in COVID-19. The study identifies specific inflammatory mediators (e.g. IL-6, IL-12p40, HGF, CCL2, IL-1RA) that correlate with the severity of neurological involvement. Autoantibodies against neuronal/glial proteins are more frequent among those with neurological symptoms. Beyond the acute phase, even after systemic inflammation and autoantibody levels decline, markers of brain injury (notably NfL and GFAP) remain elevated in people who had neurological complications. This indicates that some forms of brain injury in COVID-19 may be long-lasting or slow to resolve, despite resolution of overt inflammation.",

Specifically, CD4+ T cell populations in LC are more likely to express markers that allow them to home to inflamed tissues, and SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells show exhaustion signatures. There is also a miscoordination between T-cell and B-cell (antibody) responses in LC, suggesting that though both adaptive arms are active, they are not working in a well-orchestrated way. These immune irregularities may underlie the persistent symptoms seen in LC ‚Äî such as fatigue, cognitive issues, sleep disturbances ‚Äî perhaps driven by ongoing antigen exposure or dysregulated immune signaling. The study‚Äôs depth (multi-omics) provides pieces of a mechanism: immune dysregulation, chronic inflammation, and maladapted adaptive immunity.

Both groups report persistent symptoms of similar severity, indicating that immune response strength or detectability does not map straightforwardly onto symptom burden.

SARS-CoV-2 does not integrate into the host genome, replicates in the cytoplasm with proofreading, and uses ACE2 (plus proteases) for cell entry, leading to a relatively faster replication cycle. In contrast, HIV-1 reverse-transcribes its RNA, integrates into host DNA, uses CD4 plus co-receptors for entry, has high error rates (hence high diversity), and establishes latent infection, which makes eradication extremely difficult. Because of these mechanistic differences, their interactions with the immune system diverge: HIV-1‚Äôs dense glycan shield, latent reservoirs, and high mutation rate impede development of broadly neutralizing antibodies, while SARS-CoV-2 tends to be more ‚Äúopen‚Äù to vaccine-elicited neutralizing immune responses, despite also evolving escape variants.",

In addition, those with active Long COVID show elevated markers of blood cell damage, platelet activation, and monocyte-platelet interactions, all hinting at ongoing inflammation and coagulation (thromboinflammation). The study also found that higher antibody levels against herpesviruses might be contributing to triggering the classical complement pathway. The results point to specific protein signatures in blood that could serve as biomarkers to distinguish Long COVID patients from recovered ones, and suggest that complement and coagulation pathways are potential therapeutic targets.",

The authors combine mutation detection in field wastewater samples over 2021‚Äì2022 with controlled experiments using mutant synthetic templates to show that even a single nucleotide change in the probe binding region can reduce assay sensitivity. As a result, N1 results can be depressed relative to N2, particularly during later Omicron waves when such mutations became common.

			"Text": "This review compares influenza and SARS-CoV-2 in the respiratory tract, examining how viral tropism, host immune responses, and tissue damage intersect to produce a spectrum of disease severities. While the host immune response is essential for clearance, it can also drive pathology, particularly when dysregulated. Influenza binds to sialic acids on epithelial cells (mostly upper airway), with avian vs. human adaptation defined by Œ±2,3 vs. Œ±2,6 linkages. SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 (with TMPRSS2 and other proteases assisting entry), expressed in subsets of ciliated cells, type II alveolar cells, and other epithelia. This narrower receptor distribution partly explains distinct tissue targets and pathogenesis. Influenza tends to infect upper respiratory tract cells more readily (though severe strains can descend into alveoli). SARS-CoV-2 can infect both upper and lower respiratory tract, with significant consequences in alveolar regions and vascular compartments ‚Äî this contributes to severe pneumonia and ARDS-like pathology. Influenza has a short incubation period (1‚Äì2 days) and rapid onset of symptoms, so transmission peaks around or after symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2 has a longer incubation (4‚Äì6 days) and allows pre-symptomatic transmission, which has major implications for pandemic spread. Influenza typically induces a brisk interferon response, sometimes protective but also damaging if excessive. SARS-CoV-2 often shows a blunted or delayed interferon response, with later excessive inflammation (e.g., cytokine storm) contributing to pathology. Influenza usually causes epithelial necrosis and damage in conducting airways, with repair via proliferation of basal and alveolar type II cells. SARS-CoV-2 often involves diffuse alveolar damage, endothelial injury, microvascular thrombosis, and sometimes long-lasting epithelial dysplasia or fibrosis ‚Äî more extensive and protracted repair failure than typical influenza.",

These genes cluster in biological processes tied to cell cycle control, DNA repair, immune modulation, and cellular stress responses. Through network analyses, the authors highlight several genes (hub nodes) as potential key mediators, and explore candidate drug compounds that might target these genes or their pathways. Overall, the study suggests that COVID-19 may aggravate lung cancer progression via shared molecular mechanisms, and that some of these molecules may be actionable in the context of co-morbid disease. However, the study is limited in that it is purely computational and based on secondary (public) transcriptomic datasets; there is no experimental or clinical validation of the proposed signatures or drug targets. Moreover, because the datasets derive from different sources (with potential batch effects, differences in sample handling, heterogeneity of patient populations), the overlap of genes may partly reflect technical or sampling artifacts rather than true biological intersection. The approach also does not resolve causality (i.e., whether COVID-19 drives those changes in lung cancer, or vice versa). Finally, since the analysis focuses on lung cancer patients and shared genes, the findings may not generalize to noncancer populations or reflect complexities of the in vivo microenvironment (e.g., spatial heterogeneity, tumor‚Äìimmune cell interactions).",

For viruses like HPV, HBV and MCV, integration of viral DNA into host genomes is a pivotal carcinogenic trigger that elevates oncogene expression; activation yet manipulation of DNA damage response pathways (e.g., ATM/Chk2) further enables transformation.

			"Text": "Choi et al. conducted a serosurvey among 79 domestic cats in New York City during 2020‚Äì2021, detecting SARS-CoV-2‚Äìspecific antibodies in 16% overall (and up to 44% in fall 2020). Over half of those antibody-positive cats also had measurable neutralizing activity. There was no clear correlation between seropositivity and respiratory symptoms or typical demographic factors. The study supports the notion that spillover from humans to cats occurred during the early pandemic, even if cat infections were largely subclinical. The study is limited by its modest sample size and the fact that the cats were drawn from an animal hospital population rather than a randomized community sample, raising potential sampling bias. Temporal sampling was uneven, and the high prevalence in fall 2020 may reflect selection or outbreak effects rather than stable prevalence. The study is cross-sectional (with limited longitudinal follow-up), so it cannot resolve directionality of transmission (e.g. cat-to-human) or dynamics of viral shedding. Finally, the serological and neutralization assays, while sensitive, cannot distinguish between recent versus past infection, nor necessarily detect low-level exposures.",

			"Text": "This study profiled post-mortem brainstem, cerebellum, and olfactory tissues from individuals who died of COVID-19 at different disease stages using single-nucleus transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics, and proteomics. In acute cases, the brainstem showed a pronounced type I interferon inflammatory response that was attenuated in late-phase cases. Spatial mapping revealed two patterns: a neuronal response centered on cranial nerve nuclei and a diffuse perivascular pattern involving oligodendrocytes, microglia, and astrocytes. The authors infer that local immune reactions, likely triggered by systemic inflammation, can disturb brain function without ongoing viral persistence in the CNS. This provides a plausible explanation for neurologic symptoms during and after acute infection and emphasizes neuroinflammation‚Äînot direct neurotropism‚Äîas a key mechanism.",

The risks were higher among those with more severe COVID-19, and analyses over time showed that the risk of asthma and bronchiectasis continued rising while risks for COPD, ILD, PVD and lung cancer declined. In those with SARS-CoV-2 reinfection versus a single infection, the hazards for respiratory outcomes were even more elevated (e.g. asthma HR ~3.0).",

About 21.4% of residents had a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and 1.5% required hospitalization. The 30-day mortality among confirmed infections was 1.6%, declining over time (from 11.4% early 2020 to 0.4% in early 2022), while among hospitalized patients the 30-day mortality was 10.8%, decreasing from 14.0% to 6.0% over the same period. Risk of death was higher with older age, male gender, greater socioeconomic deprivation, and underlying comorbidities, reflecting consistent predictors of worse outcomes. The authors present this as a framework for cross-regional comparisons of COVID-19 burden.

Using ~20 LTL‚Äêassociated SNPs and large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) datasets from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (e.g. 38,984 cases vs 1,644,784 controls for susceptibility), the authors found no significant associations in either direction, and no detectable genetic correlation between telomere length and COVID-19 outcomes. Sensitivity analyses and alternate instrument sets yielded consistent null results.

The authors caution that their power is limited (instruments explain only a small proportion of LTL variance), and nonlinear effects or contributions of extremely short telomeres cannot be excluded.",

The spatial pattern of excess deaths shifted over time: early in the pandemic, excess mortality clustered in large urban counties (especially in the Northeast), but later waves brought stronger increases in rural counties, particularly in the South and West. The authors attribute part of this shift to differential vaccination uptake, rural health resource constraints, and challenges in accurate death attribution, and call for more attention to rural communities and improvements in mortality surveillance.",

These virus-harboring MKs appear to produce platelets that also contain viral RNA and Spike, and microclots were observed in all Long COVID participants. Additionally, about 30% of Long COVID patients had detectable Spike protein in plasma (at picogram levels), and levels of platelet serotonin and the enzyme TPH-1 were significantly reduced in LC versus recovered individuals.",

Although molnupiravir accelerated viral decline during treatment (viral half-life ~0.41 days vs ~0.72 days in usual care), by Day 14 the molnupiravir group showed significantly higher viral RNA persistence and lower anti-spike antibody titers (~2,200 U/mL lower). Modeling suggested that to suppress viral RNA below detection in 95 % of patients might require a longer (‚âà10-day) regimen. Genomic sequencing revealed that molnupiravir-treated viruses carried increased mutational burdens (on average ~180 extra mutations, higher transition:transversion ratios) and greater diversity. Among residual virus, ~16.7 % of tested samples were culture-positive, with some viable virus detectable up to 9 days post-treatment. No strong signal of consensus-level spike escape mutations was found yet several recurrent substitutions in polymerase and nonstructural proteins emerged. The authors caution that the standard 5-day molnupiravir course may be too short, potentially risking persistence of mutated virus and attenuated antibody responses, and they suggest that longer treatment durations warrant investigation.",

They found that IL-1Œ≤ was elevated in both COVID-19 groups, while IL-8 was elevated only in the nLongC group; BDNF and cortisol were also increased in both groups compared to controls. In nEVs, the nLongC group showed marked upregulation of proteins linked to neurodegeneration (AŒ≤42, pTau181, TDP-43, etc.), whereas the Cov group showed more limited changes (only AŒ≤40). These findings support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to chronic peripheral inflammation and sustained stress responses, and may drive pathological changes in neuronal vesicle cargo associated with neurodegeneration.",

They show that one of the candidate ‚Äúchimeric‚Äù Spike variants (Spike1 / RBD1) recapitulates binding energetics close to SARS-CoV-2‚Äôs RBD‚ÄìhACE2 (‚Äì23.73 vs ‚Äì24.7; ‚Äì80.7 vs ‚Äì81.2 kcal/mol) yet has much weaker binding to the P2C-1F11 neutralizing antibody (‚Äì22.7 vs ‚Äì83.7 kcal/mol), suggesting that their method could have ‚Äúforeseen‚Äù a SARS-CoV-2‚Äìlike lineage from SARS-CoV-1. The authors argue that such in silico forecasting, combined with genomic surveillance and pre-emptive broad neutralization strategies, might reduce the severity of future SARS-CoV pandemics. However, the method is demonstrated only retrospectively, and there remain substantial uncertainties about how well computationally predicted lineages correspond to viable viruses in nature. The assay relies heavily on modeling assumptions, limited mutation frequency data, clustering heuristics, and idealized binding-energy estimates, without experimental validation or consideration of other evolutionary pressures (e.g. viral replication fitness, immune environment, host ecology). Thus, while conceptually interesting, the predictive power in real-world viral emergence remains speculative.",

			"Text": "This review posits that SARS-CoV-2 infection forces a sweeping rewiring of host cellular metabolism‚Äîsugar, lipid, amino acid, nucleotide, and redox pathways‚Äîby hijacking viral‚Äìhost protein interactions and essential host factors like ACE2, NRP1, furin, TMPRSS2, and CTSL. The authors argue that beyond the acute infection, a residual human metabolic reprogramming / dysregulation (HMRD) can persist even when the virus is cleared, providing a unifying mechanistic basis for many of the multi-system symptoms observed in long COVID (PASC). They categorize PASC sufferers into four sub-phenotypes based on dominant organ impairments and link them to underlying metabolic derangements.",
