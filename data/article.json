Using flow cytometry, significantly higher CD95 (Fas) and PD-1 expression on both CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells were observed in 42 COVID-19 patients when compared to controls. Higher CD95 expression in CD4+ cells correlated with lower CD4+ counts. A higher expression of CD95 in CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes correlated with a lower percentage of naive events. This suggests a shift to antigen-activated T cells, expressing molecules increasing their propensity to apoptosis and exhaustion during COVID-19 infection.",

Consequently, we urgently need to understand and respond to the covert yet potentially incapacitating neurological consequences of COVID-19 in the acute and chronic phases of the disease.",

The effect of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 proteins on Œ±-synuclein aggregation was investigated. It was shown, in test tube experiments, that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-protein) has no effect on Œ±-synuclein aggregation, while SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) considerably speeds up the aggregation process. There was formation of multiprotein complexes and eventually amyloid fibrils. Microinjection of N-protein in SH-SY5Y cells disturbed the Œ±-synuclein proteostasis and increased cell death.",

This results in an extra two (95% confidence interval (CI) 0, 3), one (95% CI 0, 2) and six (95% CI 2, 8) myocarditis events per 1‚Äâmillion people vaccinated with ChAdOx1, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, respectively, in the 28‚Äâdays following a first dose and an extra ten (95% CI 7, 11) myocarditis events per 1‚Äâmillion vaccinated in the 28‚Äâdays after a second dose of mRNA-1273. This compares with an extra 40 (95% CI 38, 41) myocarditis events per 1‚Äâmillion patients in the 28‚Äâdays following a SARS-CoV-2 positive test. Increased risks of pericarditis and cardiac arrhythmias following a positive SARS-CoV-2 test was observed. Similar associations were not observed with any of the COVID-19 vaccines, apart from an increased risk of arrhythmia following a second dose of mRNA-1273. Subgroup analyses by age showed the increased risk of myocarditis associated with the two mRNA vaccines was present only in those younger than 40.",

Viral loads ranged from 63-5821 N gene copies per expiratory activity per participant, with high person-to-person variation. Patients earlier in illness were more likely to emit detectable RNA. Two participants, sampled on day 3 of illness, accounted for 52% of total viral load. Overall, 94% of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies were emitted by talking and singing. Interestingly, 7 participants emitted more virus from talking than singing. Overall, fine aerosols constituted 85% of the viral load detected in our study. Virus cultures were negative.",

It found that patients with COVID-19 exhibit marked increases in autoantibody reactivities as compared to uninfected individuals, and show a high prevalence of autoantibodies against immunomodulatory proteins (including cytokines, chemokines, complement components and cell-surface proteins). It was established that these autoantibodies perturb immune function and impair virological control by inhibiting immunoreceptor signalling and by altering peripheral immune cell composition, and found that mouse surrogates of these autoantibodies increase disease severity in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Rather, higher magnitudes of pre-existing betacoronavirus antibodies correlate with more SARS-CoV-2 antibodies following infection, an indicator of greater disease severity. Additionally, immunization with hCCCoV spike proteins before SARS-CoV-2 immunization impedes the generation of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in mice.",
