Using flow cytometry, significantly higher CD95 (Fas) and PD-1 expression on both CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells were observed in 42 COVID-19 patients when compared to controls. Higher CD95 expression in CD4+ cells correlated with lower CD4+ counts. A higher expression of CD95 in CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes correlated with a lower percentage of naive events. This suggests a shift to antigen-activated T cells, expressing molecules increasing their propensity to apoptosis and exhaustion during COVID-19 infection.",

Prior COVID-19 infection was associated with a 27% increased likelihood of developing new-onset erectile dysfunction when compared to those without prior infection. 42,406 men experienced a COVID-19 infection between January 2020 and January 2021 of which 601 (1.42%) developed new onset erectile dysfunction within 6.5 months follow up. On multivariable analysis while controlling for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, smoking, obesity, hypogonadism, thromboembolism, and malignancy, prior COVID-19 infection was associated with increased risk of new onset erectile dysfunction (HR 1.27; 95% CI 1.1‚Äì1.5; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.002).",

Hypogeusia, dysgeusia, and ageusia were also evaluated by a meta-analysis, and the pooled prevalence was 34% for hypogeusia, 33% for dysgeusia, and 26% for ageusia. Xerostomia was a new feature of this update, and the pooled data demonstrated a prevalence of 43% (95% CI = 36% to 50%, I2 = 71%) in patients with COVID-19. Regarding oral mucosal lesions, the most common clinical pattern was aphthous like, followed by herpes-like lesions, candidiasis, glossitis/depapillation/geographic tongue, parotitis, and angular cheilitis. Oral lesions were more frequent in the tongue, lips, and palate, presenting miscellaneous clinical aspects that are more likely to represent coinfections.",

The effect of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 proteins on Œ±-synuclein aggregation was investigated. It was shown, in test tube experiments, that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-protein) has no effect on Œ±-synuclein aggregation, while SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) considerably speeds up the aggregation process. There was formation of multiprotein complexes and eventually amyloid fibrils. Microinjection of N-protein in SH-SY5Y cells disturbed the Œ±-synuclein proteostasis and increased cell death.",

It found that patients with COVID-19 exhibit marked increases in autoantibody reactivities as compared to uninfected individuals, and show a high prevalence of autoantibodies against immunomodulatory proteins (including cytokines, chemokines, complement components and cell-surface proteins). It was established that these autoantibodies perturb immune function and impair virological control by inhibiting immunoreceptor signalling and by altering peripheral immune cell composition, and found that mouse surrogates of these autoantibodies increase disease severity in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Plasma levels of IL-1Œ≤, IL-1RA, and IL-8, among others, were also increased in patients who recovered from COVID-19. This altered immunophenotype was mirrored by a reduced ex vivo T cell response to both non-specific and specific stimulation, revealing a dysfunctional status of T cells, including a poor response to SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Altered levels of plasma soluble PD-L1, as well as of PD1 promoter methylation and PD1-targeting miR‚Äì15-5p, in CD8+ T cells were also observed, suggesting abnormal function of the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint axis. Notably, ex vivo blockade of PD-1 nearly normalized the aforementioned immunophenotype and restored T cell function, reverting the observed post‚ÄìCOVID-19 immune abnormalities; indeed, an increased T cell‚Äìmediated response to SARS-CoV-2 peptides was noted. Finally, in a neutralization assay, PD-1 blockade did not alter the ability of T cells to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus infection. Immune checkpoint blockade ameliorates post‚ÄìCOVID-19 immune abnormalities and stimulates an anti‚ÄìSARS-CoV-2 immune response.",

The injection of the spike protein alone caused cell death in the brain, highlighting a direct effect on brain tissue. Furthermore, the presence of spike protein was observed in the skull of the deceased long after their COVID-19 infection, suggesting that the spike‚Äôs persistence may contribute to long-term neurological symptoms. The spike protein was associated with neutrophil-related pathways and dysregulation of the proteins involved in the PI3K-AKT as well as complement and coagulation pathway.  ",

Five studies involving a total of 1643 cases, including 597 cases of asymptomatic and 1043 cases of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in this meta-analysis.

The NKT-like cell subset was decreased in patients with lethal outcome of COVID-19, which implies an antiviral role of this cell subpopulation and emphasizes its prognostic value. Along with an increase in the expression levels of HLA-DR and PD-1, and elevated IL-6 serum concentration, an increase in the CD16+ cell proportion among CD56‚àí T cells may be considered the factor associated with increased COVID-19-mediated mortality. Moreover, a decrease in the expression of the NKG2D and NKG2A NK cell receptors observed in T cells of COVID-19 patients can potentially serve as prognostic indicators of the disease severity.

Results indicated that CSF proteome changes after infection resolution corresponded with bronchial virus abundance during early infection and revealed substantial differences between the infected non-human primates and their age-matched uninfected controls, suggesting these differences could reflect altered secretion of CNS factors in response to SARS-CoV-2-induced neuropathology. Infected animals exhibited highly scattered data distributions compared to their corresponding controls indicating the heterogeneity of the CSF proteome change and the host response to the viral infection. Dysregulated CSF proteins were preferentially enriched in functional pathways associated with progressive neurodegenerative disorders, hemostasis, and innate immune responses that could influence neuroinflammatory responses following COVID-19. Mapping these dysregulated proteins to the Human Brain Protein Atlas found that they tended to be enriched in brain regions that exhibit more frequent injury following COVID-19. It, therefore, appears reasonable to speculate that such CSF protein changes could serve as signatures for neurologic injury, identify important regulatory pathways in this process, and potentially reveal therapeutic targets to prevent or attenuate the development of neurologic injuries following COVID-19.",

The addition of exogenous ceramide after the downregulation of ASM by pharmacological inhibition restores infection with SARS-CoV-2. Thus, ceramide on the cell surface is necessary for infection with SARS-CoV-2. The ASM/ceramide system may be important not only for virus entry into the cell but also for the release of cytokines such as IL-6. Antidepressants reduce the level of proinflammatory cytokines in preclinical studies and patients with major depressive disorder. Importantly, reduced IL-6 levels were also found in COVID-19 patients treated with the FIASMA hydroxyzine. The ASM/ceramide system can help to explain the typical risk factors for a lethal COVID-19 course since ceramide abundance is increased in advanced age, hypertension or obesity, and the increased rate of thromboembolic complications in the setting of COVID-19 can also be explained by the ASM/ceramide system. The ASM/ceramide system may also help to explain the negative effect of chloroquine in the therapy of patients with COVID-19.",

More severe initial infection = more severe re-infection. Mild initial infection doesn‚Äôt guarantee mild reinfection; two-thirds of severe reinfections had a mild initial episode.",

Following in utero infection, developmental and neurological consequences are seen in neonatal mice.

The same phenomena were observed in the young (age < 50) and old (age ‚â• 50) populations. Together, an accelerated epigenetic aging in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection was found. An increasing acceleration of epigenetic aging in the sequential samples of healthy, non-severe and severe groups was found. The accelerated DNAm ages at initial phases were partly reversed at the later phases in some COVID-19 patients by using the five epigenetic clocks, while the reversible outcome of accelerated attrition of DNAm TL from initial to later phases was found only in one patient. COVID-19 syndrome might accelerate epigenetic aging in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, and this process would be partly reversible in the clinical disease phases.",

By 120 days, vaccination had reduced the number of long covid symptoms (mean 13.0 (standard deviation 9.4) in the vaccinated group v 14.8 (9.8) in the control group; mean difference -1.8, 95% confidence interval -3.0 to -0.5) and doubled the rate of patients in remission (16.6% v 7.5%, hazard ratio 1.93, 95% confidence interval 1.18 to 3.14). Vaccination reduced the effect of long covid on patients' lives (mean score on the impact tool 24.3 (standard deviation 16.7) v 27.6 (16.7); mean difference -3.3, 95% confidence interval -5.7 to -1.0) and the proportion of patients with an unacceptable symptom state (38.9% v 46.4%, risk difference -7.4%, 95% confidence interval -14.5% to -0.3%). In the vaccinated group, two (0.4%) patients reported serious adverse events requiring admission to hospital.",
