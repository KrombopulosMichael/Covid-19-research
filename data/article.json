C3a-rich environment in severe COVID-19 promotes differentiation of CD16+ T cells. Activated CD16+ T cells and complement proteins are associated with fatal outcome",

However, Omicron exceeded both the wt and the Delta strain with respect to the ability to withstand the antiviral state imposed by IFN-alpha.",

Using flow cytometry, significantly higher CD95 (Fas) and PD-1 expression on both CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells were observed in 42 COVID-19 patients when compared to controls. Higher CD95 expression in CD4+ cells correlated with lower CD4+ counts. A higher expression of CD95 in CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes correlated with a lower percentage of naive events. This suggests a shift to antigen-activated T cells, expressing molecules increasing their propensity to apoptosis and exhaustion during COVID-19 infection.",
