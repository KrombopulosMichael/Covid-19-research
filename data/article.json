All strains and variants tested (Wuhan, Gamma, Delta, Omicron/BA.1, and the ORF7ab‚Äêdeleted mutant) showed ability to infect (or at least presence of virus) in the olfactory bulbs. Viral titers and RNA loads in olfactory bulbs were above detection for all groups. Evidence supports the olfactory pathway (sensory neurons in nose ‚Üí olfactory epithelium ‚Üí olfactory bulb neurons) as a route for brain invasion. No strong evidence was found for infection spreading via blood vessels or widespread brain infection beyond olfactory bulbs in this model. Retrograde and anterograde movement along axons was observed in in vitro neuron-epithelial systems. The original Wuhan strain caused the most severe clinical signs (e.g. weight loss), followed by Gamma, then Delta, and Omicron/BA.1 caused the mildest signs. Wuhan strain: high rate of full anosmia (complete loss) in many animals. Gamma: fewer full anosmia, but many animals had impaired smell. Delta & Omicron/BA.1: no detectable olfactory deficits in the behavioral test used ‚Äì they did not lose smell. Removing ORF7ab from the Wuhan strain reduced incidence of anosmia: only ~25% of animals with ORF7-deleted virus showed anosmia vs ~62.5% with wild-type Wuhan. However, deletion of ORF7ab did not reduce neuroinvasion: virus still reached olfactory bulbs, etc.",

Using flow cytometry, significantly higher CD95 (Fas) and PD-1 expression on both CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells were observed in 42 COVID-19 patients when compared to controls. Higher CD95 expression in CD4+ cells correlated with lower CD4+ counts. A higher expression of CD95 in CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes correlated with a lower percentage of naive events. This suggests a shift to antigen-activated T cells, expressing molecules increasing their propensity to apoptosis and exhaustion during COVID-19 infection.",

It found that patients with COVID-19 exhibit marked increases in autoantibody reactivities as compared to uninfected individuals, and show a high prevalence of autoantibodies against immunomodulatory proteins (including cytokines, chemokines, complement components and cell-surface proteins). It was established that these autoantibodies perturb immune function and impair virological control by inhibiting immunoreceptor signalling and by altering peripheral immune cell composition, and found that mouse surrogates of these autoantibodies increase disease severity in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Plasma levels of IL-1Œ≤, IL-1RA, and IL-8, among others, were also increased in patients who recovered from COVID-19. This altered immunophenotype was mirrored by a reduced ex vivo T cell response to both non-specific and specific stimulation, revealing a dysfunctional status of T cells, including a poor response to SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Altered levels of plasma soluble PD-L1, as well as of PD1 promoter methylation and PD1-targeting miR‚Äì15-5p, in CD8+ T cells were also observed, suggesting abnormal function of the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint axis. Notably, ex vivo blockade of PD-1 nearly normalized the aforementioned immunophenotype and restored T cell function, reverting the observed post‚ÄìCOVID-19 immune abnormalities; indeed, an increased T cell‚Äìmediated response to SARS-CoV-2 peptides was noted. Finally, in a neutralization assay, PD-1 blockade did not alter the ability of T cells to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus infection.

The PPs of long-term consequences after asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections were 17.13% (95%CI, 7.55‚Äì26.71%) for at least one symptom, 15.09% (95%CI, 5.46‚Äì24.73%) for loss of taste, 14.14% (95%CI, ‚àí1.32‚Äì29.61%) for loss of smell, and 9.33% (95%CI, 3.07‚Äì15.60) for fatigue. Compared with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, asymptomatic infection was associated with a significantly lower risk of developing COVID-19-related sequelae (p < 0.05), with 80% lower risk of developing at least one symptom (OR = 0.20, 95%CI, 0.09‚Äì0.45), 81% lower risk of fatigue (OR = 0.19, 95%CI, 0.08‚Äì0.49), 90% lower risk of loss of taste/smell (OR = 0.10, 95%CI, 0.02‚Äì0.58). These results suggested that there were long-term effects of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as loss of taste or smell, fatigue, cough and so on. However, the risk of developing long-term symptoms in asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected persons was significantly lower than those in symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection cases.",

Results indicated that CSF proteome changes after infection resolution corresponded with bronchial virus abundance during early infection and revealed substantial differences between the infected non-human primates and their age-matched uninfected controls, suggesting these differences could reflect altered secretion of CNS factors in response to SARS-CoV-2-induced neuropathology. Infected animals exhibited highly scattered data distributions compared to their corresponding controls indicating the heterogeneity of the CSF proteome change and the host response to the viral infection. Dysregulated CSF proteins were preferentially enriched in functional pathways associated with progressive neurodegenerative disorders, hemostasis, and innate immune responses that could influence neuroinflammatory responses following COVID-19. Mapping these dysregulated proteins to the Human Brain Protein Atlas found that they tended to be enriched in brain regions that exhibit more frequent injury following COVID-19. It, therefore, appears reasonable to speculate that such CSF protein changes could serve as signatures for neurologic injury, identify important regulatory pathways in this process, and potentially reveal therapeutic targets to prevent or attenuate the development of neurologic injuries following COVID-19.",

The addition of exogenous ceramide after the downregulation of ASM by pharmacological inhibition restores infection with SARS-CoV-2. Thus, ceramide on the cell surface is necessary for infection with SARS-CoV-2. The ASM/ceramide system may be important not only for virus entry into the cell but also for the release of cytokines such as IL-6. Antidepressants reduce the level of proinflammatory cytokines in preclinical studies and patients with major depressive disorder. Importantly, reduced IL-6 levels were also found in COVID-19 patients treated with the FIASMA hydroxyzine. The ASM/ceramide system can help to explain the typical risk factors for a lethal COVID-19 course since ceramide abundance is increased in advanced age, hypertension or obesity, and the increased rate of thromboembolic complications in the setting of COVID-19 can also be explained by the ASM/ceramide system. The ASM/ceramide system may also help to explain the negative effect of chloroquine in the therapy of patients with COVID-19.",

This is associated with ongoing immune activation (particularly T cells) in various body regions. T cell activation doesn‚Äôt only occur in people with Long COVID symptoms. Certain tissues (gut wall, spinal cord) show stronger association with symptoms. That suggests some, but not all, of the immune activation may contribute to symptom persistence. The study investigated long-term tissue-level immune activation and viral persistence in people after SARS-CoV-2 infection, including in those with Long COVID symptoms. It uses imaging and tissue biopsies to look for evidence that virus or immune activation might linger long after acute infection. 24 people who had had COVID-19, imaged at times ranging 27 to 910 days after acute infection. Some had Long COVID symptoms, some didn‚Äôt. PET imaging using a tracer called [^18F]F-AraG, which specifically marks activated T lymphocytes. That allows anatomical quantification of T cell activation in various tissues. For a subset of Long COVID participants, colorectal tissue biopsies (rectosigmoid) were examined for presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via in situ hybridization, and via immunohistochemistry. Blood plasma protein profiling showed that people with more Long COVID symptoms (>5) and higher tissue uptake had elevated markers of immune activation/inflammation. In biopsied colorectal (rectosigmoid) tissue from a subset of Long COVID participants, SARS-CoV-2 RNA (spike gene) was detected in lamina propria cells. The period after infection ranged from ~158 to ~676 days. In spinal cord and gut wall in particular, the degree of T cell activation was associated with presence of Long COVID symptoms. Elevated activation in a variety of tissues, even long after infection (up to ~2.5 years). T cell activation (measured by PET tracer uptake) was higher in the post-acute COVID group compared to controls in many anatomical sites: brainstem, spinal cord, gut wall, bone marrow, hilar lymphoid tissue, cardiopulmonary tissue, nasopharyngeal tissue, etc. ",

Eigenvector Centrality_Œî (ECŒî): change in centrality in various brain regions (a measure from functional connectivity / network analysis) pre‚Üípost COVID vs controls.

In particular, reduced EC_Œî in the left amygdala was observed in the COVID+ group. COVID+ participants showed reduced performance in spatial working memory compared to controls post-infection. Importantly, the reduction in connectivity (EC_Œî) in the left amygdala mediated the relationship between having had COVID-19 and poorer spatial working memory. These effects were observed even though infections were mild and in young people; suggesting that even mild COVID-19 may lead to lasting structural/functional brain changes and modest cognitive changes.",

Lower intracellular amino acids, and lower levels of metabolites of the Krebs (TCA) cycle. Increased signs of autophagy, and signs of apoptosis in some cases. The degradation products of tryptophan (kynurenine metabolites) are altered: specific patterns correlate with severity/symptomology. The enzyme IDO2 seems to be a driver of these changes.

Those who got reinfected had lower neutralizing antibody titres (for both ancestral strain and Omicron BA.1), and lower anti-RBD IgG and IgA antibodies after their initial Omicron infection, compared to those who did not get reinfected. Time since last vaccine dose, age, sex, frailty, and number of facility outbreaks were not significantly associated with reinfection risk in the group already with prior Omicron infection. Some different vaccine brand combinations (mRNA-1273 vs BNT162b2) showed small signals of different risk, but overall hybrid immunity in this older cohort was quite heterogeneous. The study investigated 750 older adults (residents of long-term care and retirement homes) who were highly vaccinated (four doses of monovalent mRNA vaccine) to see how well hybrid immunity (vaccine + infection) protects against reinfection, particularly with Omicron subvariants.

			"Text": "Researchers analyzed biopsies of fungiform papillae‚Äîthe taste structures on the tongue in 16 individuals with long-term taste loss compared to pre-pandemic and never-infected controls. Using microscopy, immunofluorescence, and RNA in situ hybridization, they found SARS-CoV-2 proteins (spike and nucleocapsid) in the epithelial layers and lamina propria of the papillae. In several cases, negative-strand RNA was also detected, indicating active viral replication in taste tissue up to 40 weeks after infection. The infected papillae showed disrupted taste bud architecture, with missing or misshapen buds and a loss of neurite fibers that normally connect to sensory nerves. Patients with partial recovery over time displayed regrowth of nerve fibers and restoration of papilla structure, while viral protein clearance appeared patchy across the tongue. These findings provide strong evidence that long-term taste dysfunction in COVID-19 is linked to local viral persistence and structural damage rather than solely systemic inflammation. The results underscore that some Long COVID symptoms may stem from direct viral reservoirs in sensory tissues, highlighting the importance of exploring antiviral and regenerative strategies for treatment.",

Risk of developing long COVID was higher in females, those with lower education, and those who experienced symptoms like fatigue, headache, tachycardia, respiratory issues, or neurocognitive complaints during acute infection. Certain factors (ICU stay, smell/taste loss, cardiovascular problems) increased odds of recovery, while muscle pain, attention impairment, and breathing or heart rate problems reduced it.

Many of these antibodies persisted for months (e.g., 69% of IgM anti-Œ≤2-GPI remained positive), suggesting a durable autoimmune response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection. While most autoantibody-positive patients did not experience worse outcomes, IgG anticardiolipin positivity was associated with more severe clinical trajectories.",

			"Text": "üß´Using human pancreatic tissue and cell models, researchers show that SARS-CoV-2 infects and replicates in both endocrine and exocrine pancreatic cells. In Œ≤ cells, infection correlates with fewer insulin secretory granules and blunted insulin release in response to glucose, while exocrine cell infection points to wider pancreatic involvement. Infectious virus was recoverable, confirming productive replication in the pancreas.",

			"Text": "Severe COVID-19 patients often exhibit gut fungal dysbiosis, particularly overgrowth of Candida albicans. This is associated with elevated antifungal antibodies, systemic neutrophilia, and lasting transcriptional changes in granulocyte progenitors, indicating durable immune reprogramming. These immune changes persisted for up to a year after recovery, suggesting that gut fungi act as long-term drivers of systemic inflammation.üêÅIn mouse models, Candida colonization exacerbated lung inflammation during SARS-CoV-2 infection, while antifungal therapy or IL-6 receptor blockade/tocilizumab mitigated these effects. Patients treated with tocilizumab also showed reduced antifungal antibodies and immune reprogramming.",

			"Text": "In a large cohort of U.S. Medicare patients aged 65+, early outpatient treatment for COVID-19 with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) was associated with a modest but statistically significant reduction in the risk of developing post-COVID-19 condition (Long COVID) symptoms at 4-12 weeks after infection. The untreated group had a ~14.5% incidence of PCC; treatment with nirmatrelvir lowered that to ~11.8%, for an absolute risk reduction of ~2.7%. Molnupiravir also showed some benefit but smaller, with an absolute risk reduction of ~0.8%. Overall, among 3‚ÄØ975‚ÄØ690 outpatients with COVID-19, 57% remained in the study after exclusion. Among them, 19.5% received nirmatrelvir and 2.6% received molnupiravir.",

			"Text": "This methodological critique shows that mask trials/meta-analyses conflate infections occurring inside the study‚Äôs controlled setting with those acquired outside it, mathematically biasing effect estimates toward the null and yielding over-narrow confidence intervals. A simple correction using the fraction of outside infections (b) reveals that many ‚Äúno difference‚Äù conclusions are uninformative: a wide range of true effects could produce observed risk ratios near 1 when b is large. Re-examining key datasets (including Loeb 2022) and the Cochrane review under this framework, the authors argue that N95s likely provide substantially greater protection than surgical masks, and that accounting for source control and two-way masking magnifies benefits. They also note that reported ‚Äúadverse events‚Äù are mostly mild (discomfort, skin irritation, headaches).",
